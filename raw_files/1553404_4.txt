Our financial results for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital Deficit
Cash Flows
As of March 31, 2020, we had $21,386,934 in cash, $64,182,889 in total current assets, $67,713, 871 in total current liabilities, and a working capital deficit of $3,530,982, compared to a working capital deficit of $5,265,387 at March 31, 2019. The Company’s working capital improved as profitable operations provide working capital and operating cash flows to the Company. The Company’s contract assets, contract liabilities and accruals change significantly from period to period, depending on the status of equipment deliveries, customer receipts and payments to third party manufacturers. As at March 31, 2020, we have experienced a significant increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities to $43,898,569. The increase is primarily attributable to manufacturing and commissioning costs which have not been invoiced to the Company and accrued additional consideration due for the Engin acquisition estimated at $ 5,190,023.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, we received $23,449,250 from operating activities, whereas we spent $2,795,220 on operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2019. Operating cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2020 primarily consist of deposits and instalments received from customers and our corresponding manufacturing outlays. The Company is in production and manufacturing timeline where we receive large amount of deposits and instalment payments in the last 12 months. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the company was in various stages of engineering, delivery, and commissioning of 107 (2019-1) marine scrubber units which contributed to significant increase in cash flow.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $4,247,690 in investing activities, whereas we used $25,000 in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2019. Our investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2020 were primarily related to the acquisition of Engin and subsidiary and other office equipment.
During the year ended March 31, 2020, we spent $614,546 related to financing activities, whereas we received $5,451,500 from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2019 which consisted of proceeds from securities purchase agreements. Financing related activities for year ended March 31, 2020 included a payment of $750,000 by the Company to settle a block of stock purchase warrants with a shareholder and the receipt of $135,454 from a director under a share sale profit disgorgement.
Anticipated Cash Requirements
We do not anticipate requiring additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. However, if we do these funds may be raised through asset sales, equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares.
Our cash requirement estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our business activities and our ability to raise capital from our shareholders or other sources.
We currently have office locations in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, China, and Hong Kong. We have hired staff in various regions and rely heavily upon the use of contractors and consultants. Our general and administrative expenses for the year will consist primarily of technical consultants, management, salaries and wages, professional fees, transfer agent fees, bank and interest charges and general office expenses. The professional fees have grown significantly and relate to matters such as contract review, business acquisitions, regulatory filings, patent maintenance, and general legal, accounting and auditing fees.
Should we require additional funding over the next twelve months, we would intend to raise new cash requirements from private placements, shareholder loans or possibly a registered public offering (either self-underwritten or through a broker-dealer). If we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts, we may review other financing possibilities such as bank loans. At this time, we do not have a commitment from any broker-dealer to provide us with financing. There is no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.
As of March 31, 2020, we had $21,386,934 cash on hand. Our anticipated profits realized from sales of ENVI marine units are expected to fund our planned expenditure levels. After careful consideration we believe current operations, anticipated deliveries and expected profit from such deliveries to be sufficient to cover expected cash operating expenses over the next 12 months.
Going Concern
Our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Contractual Obligations
As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets, contract assets and liabilities associated with revenue contracts in progress, contingent consideration on asset acquisition, warranty accruals, fair values of convertible debentures and derivative liabilities, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Our company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our company may differ materially and adversely from our company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are comprised of patents, customer relationships, plant designs, backlog, and software licensing, Intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment. The patents, which were acquired in 2013, are being amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of 17 years. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company acquired customer relationships, plant designs, backlog, and software licensing, which are amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of 6, 6, 2, and 10 years.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
Our company reviews long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenue from the sale of emission control equipment and related services as well as providing design and engineering services for Concentrated Solar Power, desalination, and waste to energy technologies.
Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those promised products or services.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following five steps:
●identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
●identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
●determination of the transaction price;
●allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
●recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
As our contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these contracts are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. For such arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost-plus margin.
Contracts signed with one customer have significant financing component. The Company provides design, production, and installation services of scrubber units to this customer. 20% of the contract price is payable at least 6 calendar months prior to the dry dock date. The remaining 80% is payable in 24 equal monthly instalments starting at the end of the calendar month following the installation date on a vessel by vessel basis. As 80% of the contract price is payable after the last performance obligation towards the scrubber, significant financing component is separated from revenue and interest income at 5.4% is recorded when payments are received from the customer.
Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
