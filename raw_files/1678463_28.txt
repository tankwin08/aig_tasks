The Company's previous equity compensation plan under which it granted stock awards was the Forterra, Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, (the "2016 Incentive Plan"). The aggregate number of shares of common stock that was initially available for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan was 5,000,000 shares. The Company's board of directors has granted employees and independent directors options to purchase shares of common stock, shares of restricted common stock and restricted stock units. The options, restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded to employees are subject to either three-year or four-year vesting periods and the options, restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded to independent directors are subject to a one-year vesting period. The awards of stock options granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan have a term of ten years. In May 2018, the Company's shareholders approved the Forterra, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan, (the "2018 Incentive Plan"). The 2018 Incentive Plan serves as the umbrella plan for the Company’s stock-based and cash-based incentive compensation programs for its directors, officers and other eligible employees. The aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 5,000,000 shares plus any shares subject to

outstanding awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan as of the date of the approval of the 2018 Incentive Plan that on or after such date cease for any reason to be subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards to the extent they are exercised for or settled in nonforfeitable shares).
In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award or over a shorter period when employee retirement eligibility is a factor, in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments, which include stock options granted and restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees members of Forterra's Board of Directors. The Company records stock-based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $9.5 million, $7.9 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Stock Option Grants
The value of the options is determined by using a Black-Scholes pricing model that includes the following variables: 1) exercise price of the instrument, 2) fair market value of the underlying stock on date of grant, 3) expected life, 4) estimated volatility and 5) the risk-free interest rate. The Company utilized the following weighted-average assumptions in estimating the fair value of the option grants in the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:
The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expectations of future dividends and stock price volatility. Expected volatility was calculated using a weighted average of Forterra and a set of Forterra's peer companies based on an analysis of historical and implied volatility measures. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Such assumptions are only used for making the required fair value estimate and should not be considered as indicators of future dividend policy or stock price appreciation. Because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a reliable estimate of the fair value of employee stock options.

A summary of the status of the Company's stock options is presented below:
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approximately $1.0 million of unrecognized stock option compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.9 years.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Restricted stock are share awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company's common stock which become freely transferable upon vesting. Restricted stock has the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant. Restricted stock units are share awards denominated in units of the Company's common stock and are subject to a service condition. The restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards generally vest one to four years from the date of grant and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the vesting date. The estimated compensation cost of the restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, which is equal to the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
During 2020, the Company granted 0.8 million restricted stock units consisting of 0.6 million time-vested restricted stock units and 0.2 million performance-based restricted stock units. During 2019, the Company granted 2.6 million restricted stock units consisting of 1.2 million time-vested restricted stock units and 1.4 million performance-based restricted stock units. The performance-based restricted stock units vest in tranches based on the 20-day volume weighted average price of FRTA common stock based on a grant date market condition. If the performance condition is achieved, one-fourth of the tranche will vest immediately and the remainder of the tranche will be time-vested over one year from the date the performance condition was met. The Company accounts for the time-vested and performance-based restricted stock units as equity awards.

20. Income taxes
U.S. Tax Reform
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), that among other things, increased the net interest expense deduction limit to 50% of adjusted taxable income from 30% for tax years beginning January 1, 2019 and the tax year 2020, and amended Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 168(e)(3)(E) to retroactively include the qualified improvement property inadvertently classified as 39-year property under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) as property to which a 15-year recovery period applies and for which 100% bonus depreciation may be claimed. This enhanced bonus depreciation may be applied retro actively for additions after December 31, 2017.
In July of 2020, the Treasury Department released two significant final regulations: (1) final regulations with guidance on applying the limitations on the deductibility of business interest expense under IRC Section 163(j), which was significantly modified by TCJA and then temporarily modified by the CARES Act; and (2) final Section 951A regulations which allowed taxpayers to make an election to exclude certain high-taxed income of its controlled foreign corporations. The favorable impact of the CARES Act and these final regulations was reflected in the 2019 filed tax return, as well as in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts, using currently enacted tax rates.

The rate reconciliation for continuing operations presented below is based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 because the predominant business activity is in the U.S. (in thousands):
The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily attributable to statutory federal, state and international income tax expense on the continuing operations, the unfavorable impact of non-deductible executive compensation and other non-deductible expenses, partially offset with the release of the valuation allowance on assets now expected to be realized prior to expiration and the favorable effect of the retroactive tax law changes included in the prior year federal and state tax return filings.
The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of the non-deductible expenses, partially offset with the favorable effect of the partial reversal of the federal and state valuation allowances and the effect of the return to provision adjustments.
The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of the federal and state valuation allowance increase, inclusion of global intangible low-taxed income, and impact of the disposition of nondeductible goodwill in connection with the Foley exchange described in Note 3, partially offset with the favorable impact of the tax credits and state tax benefit.

Consolidated Notes to Financial Statements
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. The Company assesses whether valuation allowances should be established against deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a “more likely than not” criteria. The analysis used in determining the valuation allowance involves considerable judgment and assumptions.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, after consideration of all evidence, including the analysis of the reversal pattern of the taxable and deductible temporary differences in the future, as well as the positive factors of the recent business performance, the Company released $11.8 million of the federal, state and international valuation allowance.
Deferred income taxes are provided for the effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The net deferred tax asset (liability) balances were comprised of the following components as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):

Uncertain tax positions
The Company is subject to audit examinations at federal, state, local, and foreign levels by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge the treatment or reporting of any tax return item. The tax matters challenged by the tax authorities are typically complex; therefore, the ultimate outcomes of these challenges are subject to uncertainty. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax audit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 was finalized during the year with no changes identified for either period, respectively. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return.
Each period the Company assesses uncertain tax positions for recognition, measurement and effective settlement. Based on the Company's assessment, it determined that no liabilities for uncertain tax positions should be recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
