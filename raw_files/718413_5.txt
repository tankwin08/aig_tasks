Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. In addition to the statutes, regulations and regulatory initiatives described above, new legislation and regulations affecting financial institutions are frequently proposed. If enacted or adopted, these measures could change banking statutes and the Company’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and could further increase reporting and compliance requirements, governance structures and costs of doing business. The Company cannot predict whether any such additional legislation or other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or the effect they may have on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy
The earnings of the Company are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates money supply, credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States Government Securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings, setting reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits, regulating interest rates payable by member banks on time and savings deposits and expanding or contracting the money supply. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Company, in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.

Item 1A.
section_1A: Item 1A. Risk Factors
Before deciding to invest in the Company or to maintain or increase an investment, investors should carefully consider the material risks and uncertainties described below that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below and in the Company’s other filings with the SEC are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or that are currently deemed immaterial may emerge or evolve and also affect the Company’s business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, which in turn could result in a decline in the value of the Company’s capital stock.
ECOMONIC AND OTHER EXTERNAL RISKS
The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive to us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be significant. Moreover, the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and out of our control, and will be affected by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.
The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the national and global economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 initially caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of business and social events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability throughout our Vermont markets and nationwide. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Vermont, as well as the governments in most other states, took preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and in-person business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. These restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, including, among others, those in the travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, real estate and the health care industry, and resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees in Vermont and nationwide.
Although we continued operating during mandated shutdowns in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and could cause material disruptions in the future. Impacts to our business have included the implementation of additional health and safety precautions at our banking offices, the transition of a portion of our workforce to home locations, curtailed in-branch services, increases in customers’ inability to make scheduled loan payments, increases in requests for forbearance and loan modifications, and an adverse effect on accounting estimates that we use to determine our provision and allowance for loan losses.
While the CARES Act signed into law in March, 2020 provided fast and direct economic assistance for American workers, families, and small businesses during 2020, helping to minimize the immediate impact of the pandemic, the ultimate effects of COVID-19 on the broader economy and our markets are not known, nor is the ultimate duration or impacts of the economic and social restrictions resulting from government mitigation efforts. Moreover, the responsive actions taken by the FRB to lower the federal funds rate has negatively affected our interest income and, therefore, may adversely affect our earnings, financial condition, results of operation and prospects in future periods. Additional impacts of COVID-19 on our business could be widespread and material, and may include, or exacerbate, among other consequences, the following:
●
decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets we serve, leading to a need to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings;
●
declines in value of collateral for loans, including real estate collateral resulting in higher loan losses;
●
declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;
●
declines in demand resulting from businesses and individuals suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets.
●
our employees contracting COVID-19;
●
reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home;
●
a work stoppage, forced quarantine, or other interruption of our business;
●
unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;
●
effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls;
●
sustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;
●
declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products;
●
substantial increases in unemployment in our markets;
●
reduced consumer spending due to job losses and other effects attributable to COVID-19;
●
unprecedented volatility in U.S. financial markets ;and
●
volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio.
These factors, together or in combination with other factors, events or occurrences that may not yet be known or anticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, in both the short-term and the long-term. The further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as ongoing or new governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, may continue to materially disrupt banking and other economic activity generally and in the areas in which we operate. This could result in further decline in demand for our banking products and services, and could negatively impact, among other things, our asset quality, liquidity, regulatory capital, net income and growth prospects.
Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and the monetary policies of the FRB. If the interest rate we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments, our net interest income and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Conversely, our earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest rate we pay on deposits and borrowings. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FRB lowered the target federal funds rate to 0% to 0.25%. It is unclear how long this historically low target federal funds rate will remain in effect. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may compress, reducing our net interest income and adversely affecting our operating results. If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to re-price downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Such an occurrence would have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations.
Increases in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, such as investment securities, and may affect our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. For example, we originate loans for sale to secondary market investors, and increasing interest rates may reduce the volume of loans originated for sale, resulting in a reduction in the fee income we earn on such sales. Further, increasing interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans, resulting in an increase in our non-performing assets and a reduction in our income. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates.
In addition, increases in interest rates will increase the dividend rate on our Series A preferred stock, which is tied to the prime rate, and the interest rate on our debentures, which is tied to LIBOR. Furthermore, as discussed below, there is uncertainty as to our future interest costs on our subordinated debentures due to the scheduled phase out of LIBOR at the end of 2021. Higher preferred stock dividend payments and debenture interest costs would decrease the amount of funds available for payment of dividends on our common stock.
Our interest costs may increase as a result of the retirement of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as a reference rate for interest payments on our subordinated debentures.
