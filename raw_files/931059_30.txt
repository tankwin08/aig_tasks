Effective March 5, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets related to Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center. The purchase price was $658,537. The purchase price was made available by Mr. Diamantis, who was a director of the Company until his resignation on February 26, 2020.
On March 31, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to pledge certain of its accounts receivable as collateral against a prepaid forward purchase contract whereby the Company received consideration in the amount of $5.0 million. The receivables had an estimated collectable value of $8,700,000 and had been adjusted down to $0 as of December 31, 2017. In exchange for the consideration received, the counterparty received the right to: (i) a 20% per annum investment return from the Company on the consideration, with a minimum repayment term of six months and minimum return of $500,000, (ii) all payments recovered from the accounts receivable up to $5,250,000, if paid in full within six months, or $5,500,000, if not paid in full within six months, and (iii) 20% of all payments of the accounts receivable in excess of amounts received in (i) and (ii). On March 31, 2017, to the extent that the counterparty had not been paid $6,000,000, the Company was required to pay the difference. Mr. Diamantis guaranteed the Company’s payment obligation. On March 24, 2017, the Company, the counterparty and Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, entered into an amendment to extend the Company’s obligation to March 31, 2018. Also, what the counterparty was to receive was amended to equal (a) the $5,000,000 purchase price plus a 20% per annum investment return thereon, plus (b) $500,000, plus (c) the product of (i) the proceeds received from the accounts receivable, minus the amount set forth in clauses (a) and (b), multiplied by (ii) 40%. In connection with the extension, the counterparty received a fee of $1,000,000. On April 2, 2018, the Company, the counterparty, and Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, entered into a second amendment to extend further the Company’s obligation to May 30, 2018. In connection with this further extension, the counterparty received a fee of $100,000. The counterparty instituted an arbitration proceeding under the agreement with regard to the outstanding balance. In December 2018, the Company, Mr. Diamantis and the counterparty entered into a preliminary settlement agreement in connection with the arbitration, with the terms of the settlement agreement revised on March 31, 2019. The Company and Mr. Diamantis agreed to pay the counterparty $2,000,000 on or before April 5, 2019 and an additional $7,694,685 plus interest at 10% per annum on or before May 20, 2019, which date was subsequently amended. On April 5, 2019 and May 31, 2019, Mr. Diamantis made payments totaling $5.0 million on behalf of the Company. The final payment of $4,937,105 was due on or before July 28, 2019. Mr. Diamantis made that payment on behalf of the Company on July 26, 2019. The Company and Mr. Diamantis have now complied with all of their obligations under the settlement agreement. As a result, the Company was obligated to repay Mr. Diamantis a total of $9,937,105.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, Mr. Diamantis loaned the Company $7.6 million, the majority of which was used for working capital purposes, and the Company repaid Mr. Diamantis $4.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Mr. Diamantis advanced the Company $9.9 million, which was used for the settlement of the prepaid forward purchase contract discussed above, $0.7 million for the purchase of Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center discussed above and $6.7 million that was used primarily for working capital purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid Mr. Diamantis $2.3 million. On June 30, 2020, the Company exchanged the total amount owed to Mr. Diamantis on that date for outstanding loans and accrued interest, net of repayments, which was approximately $18.8 million, for shares of the Company’s Series M Preferred Stock. The Series M Preferred Stock is more fully discussed below.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company accrued interest of $2.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, on the loans from Mr. Diamantis. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued interest on the loans from Mr. Diamantis totaled $0.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Interest accrues on loans from Mr. Diamantis at a rate of 10% on the majority of the amounts loaned. In addition, the Company incurs interest expense related to the amounts Mr. Diamantis borrows from third-parties to loan to the Company.
On June 9, 2020, the Company filed a certificate of designation to authorize 30,000 shares of its Series M Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 per share. On June 30, 2020, the Company and Mr. Diamantis entered into an exchange agreement wherein Mr. Diamantis agreed to the extinguishment of the Company’s indebtedness to Mr. Diamantis totaling $18.8 million, including accrued interest, on that date in exchange for 22,000 shares of the Company’s Series M Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. As a result of the exchange, the Company recorded a deemed dividend of approximately $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented the difference between the $18.8 million of debt and accrued interest exchanged and the value of the Series M Preferred Stock of $22.0 million
The terms of the Series M Preferred Stock were set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 16, 2020. In particular: (i) each holder of the Series M Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of the Company’s common stock. Regardless of the number of shares of Series M Preferred Stock outstanding and so long as at least one share of Series M Preferred Stock is outstanding, the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, in the aggregate, equal to 51% of all votes entitled to be voted at any meeting of stockholders or action by written consent. Each outstanding share of the Series M Preferred Stock shall represent its proportionate share of the 51% allocated to the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock in the aggregate. The Series M Preferred Stock shall vote with the common stock and any other voting securities as if they were a single class of securities; (ii) each share of the Series M Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 90% of the average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the ten trading days immediately prior to the conversion date but in any event not less than the par value of the Company’s common stock; and (iii) dividends at the rate per annum of ten percent (10%) of the stated value per share shall accrue on each outstanding share of Series M Preferred Stock from and after the date of the original issuance of such share of Series M Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization). The dividends shall accrue from day to day, whether or not declared, and shall be cumulative and non-compounding; provided, however, that such dividend shall be payable only when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors and the Company shall be under no obligation to pay such dividends. No cash dividends shall be paid on the Company’s common stock unless the dividends are paid on the Series M Preferred Stock.
On August 13, 2020, Mr. Diamantis entered into a Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy with the Company, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede LLC (of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager) pursuant to which Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Preferred Stock held by Mr. Diamantis, Mr. Diamantis has retained all other rights under the Series M Preferred Stock.
On September 27, 2019, the Company issued a promissory note to a lender in the principal amount of $1.9 million, which was guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis. The payments due on November 8, 2019 and December 26, 2019 were not made and in February 2020 the lender sued the Company and Mr. Diamantis.

The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of Gary L. Blum and Trevor Langley is an “independent director” under applicable rules.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires the Audit Committee to approve all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has established a general pre-approval policy for certain audit and non-audit services, up to a specified amount for each identified service that may be provided by the independent auditors. The Chairman of the Audit Committee may specifically approve any service within the pre-approved audit and non-audit service category if the fees for such service exceed the maximum set forth in the policy, as long as the excess fees are not reasonably expected to exceed $50,000. Any such approval by the Chairman must be reported to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The general pre-approval fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent auditors are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee approved all services provided by Haynie during 2020 and 2019.
