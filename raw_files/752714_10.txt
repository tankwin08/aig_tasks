Mobile Modular’s gross profit for 2020 increased $12.3 million, or 9%, to $155.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:
•
Gross Profit on Rental Revenues - Rental revenues increased $6.4 million, or 4%, due to 1% higher average rental equipment on rent and 2% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 12% in 2020 and 2019 and other direct costs were 25% in 2020 and 28% in 2019, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 63% in 2020 compared to 60% and 2019. The higher rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $8.9 million, or 8%, to $118.0 million in 2020.
•
Gross Profit on Rental Related Services - Rental related services revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 3%, compared to 2019. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The decrease in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to lower amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and lower repair revenues, partly offset by increased site related services revenues. The lower revenues offset by higher gross margin percentage of 28% in 2020 compared to 25% in 2019 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $1.0 million, or 6%, to $18.6 million in 2020.
•
Gross Profit on Sales - Sales revenues increased $16.8 million, or 36%, primarily due to higher new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower gross margins of 28% in 2020 compared to 31% in 2019, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $3.2 million, or 22%, to $17.9 million in 2020. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding.
For 2020, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 4%, to $68.5 million, primarily due to higher allocated corporate expenses and increased salaries and benefit costs, partly offset by lower travel, meals and meeting costs.
