Adler Tanks rents tanks and boxes typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost. At December 31, 2020, Adler Tanks had rental equipment inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $315.7 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 39.8% at December 31, 2020 and averaged 44.6% during the year.
Seasonality
Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve.
Competition
The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies. Some of our national competitors, notably United Rentals (acquired BakerCorp in July 2018), Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini (merged with WillScot in July 2020), may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories and lower cost basis of rental equipment than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability. We may encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.

RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATION:
Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price.
Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to:
•
general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we rent and sell our products;
•
legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products;
•
the budgetary constraints of our customers;
•
seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets;
•
success of our strategic growth initiatives;
•
costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses;
•
the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales;
•
the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers;
•
the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors;
•
the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment;
•
our equipment mix, availability, utilization and pricing;
•
the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets;
•
rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete or damaged equipment;
•
movements in interest rates or tax rates;
•
changes in, and application of, accounting rules;
•
changes in the regulations applicable to us; and
•
litigation matters.
As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price.
Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock.
The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to:
•
our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors’ expectations;
•
any changes in general conditions in the global economy, the industries in which we operate or the global financial markets;
•
investors’ reaction to our press releases, public announcements or filings with the SEC;
•
the stock price performance of our competitors or other comparable companies;
•
any changes in research analysts’ coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry;
•
any sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limited trading volume of our stock;
•
any merger and acquisition activity that involves us or our competitors; and
•
other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers or competitors.
In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price.
The impact of COVID-19 on our operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, may harm our business.
We continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 outbreak around the globe. This includes evaluating the impact on our customers, suppliers, and logistics providers as well as evaluating governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus. Significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company's operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19.
Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key qualified employees is critical to the success of our business.
If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Joe Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel.
Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition.
We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Although in general we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed.
A breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business.
We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We could experience theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets
and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties.
Disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations.
