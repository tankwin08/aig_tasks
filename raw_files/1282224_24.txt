The Term Loan contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding maintenance of a maximum debt to total net worth ratio of at least 4.0:1.0 and a minimum fixed charge coverage of 1.06x based on fiscal year-end audit to be calculated as provided in the Term Loan. Further, the Term Loan contains customary negative covenants, including those that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of 42West and The Door to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans, investments or certain acquisitions, or enter into certain types of agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the bank may accelerate the maturity of the loan and declare the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In the event of 42West and The Door’s insolvency, such outstanding amounts will automatically become due and payable. 42West and The Door may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Term Loan without penalty. The bank has not yet performed its tests for compliance with debt covenants which it does on an annual basis based on the financial statements of 42West and The Door as of and for the year ended December 31. Based on the Company’s calculations, it believes it is out of compliance with certain debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, the Company has classified the entire balance of $900,292 of the Term Loan in current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet.
Payroll Protection Program Loan
Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, the Company and four of its subsidiaries executed notes and received an aggregate amount of $2,795,700 from five PPP Loans from BankUnited, N.A., under the PPP which was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. Loans obtained through the PPP are eligible to be forgiven as long as the proceeds are used for qualifying purposes and certain other conditions are met. The receipt of these funds, and the forgiveness of the loan is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on its adherence to the forgiveness criteria. The Company used the proceeds from the PPP Loans to fund payroll costs in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions of the CARES Act. The Company is following the government guidelines and tracking costs to insure 100% forgiveness of the loan, however the Company has not yet applied for forgiveness on its PPP Loans. To the extent it is not forgiven, the Company would be required to repay that portion at an interest rate of 1% over a period of two years.
As of December 31, 2020, the current and long-terms portion of the loan were $582,438 and $2,517,431, respectively.

On January 3, 2020, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund LLC, an Illinois limited liability company (“Lincoln Park”) and issued a convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $1.3 million (the “2020 Lincoln Park Note”) at a purchase price of $1.2 million together with warrants to purchase up to 41,518 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.91 per share. The securities purchase agreement provides for issuance of warrants to purchase up to 41,518 shares of our common stock on each of the second, fourth, and sixth month anniversaries of the securities purchase agreement if the principal balance has not been paid on such dates (the “2020 Lincoln Park Warrants”). As such, on each of March 4, 2020, May 4, 2020 and July 3, 2020, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 41,518 shares of its common stock. The 2020 Lincoln Park Note may be converted at any time into shares of our common stock (the “2020 Conversion Shares”) at an initial conversion price equal to the lower of (A) $5.25 per share and (B) the lower of (i) the lowest intraday sales price of our common stock on the applicable conversion date and (ii) the average of the three lowest closing sales prices of our common stock during the twelve consecutive trading days including the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date but under no circumstances lower than $3.91 per share. If an event of default under the 2020 Lincoln Park Note occurs prior to maturity, the 2020 Lincoln Park Note will be convertible into shares of Common Stock at a 15% discount to the applicable conversion price. Outstanding principal under the 2020 Lincoln Park Note will not accrue interest, except upon an event of default, in which case interest at a default rate of 18% per annum would accrue until such event of default is cured. The 2020 Lincoln Park Note matures on January 3, 2022. The proceeds of the 2020 Lincoln Park Note were used to repay the 2018 Convertible Debt described below.
