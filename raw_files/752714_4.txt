Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner.
In addition, because of recent advances in technology and well-known efforts on the part of computer hackers and cyber-terrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risks associated with potential failure to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data, which, if released, could adversely impact our customer relationships, our reputation, and even violate privacy laws. As part of our business, we develop, receive and retain confidential data about our company and our customers.
Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results.
We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.
Previously, we acquired Technology Rentals & Services (“TRS”), an electronic test equipment rental business and Adler Tanks, a liquid and solid containment rental business, as well as several smaller acquisitions that were integrated into our current operating segments. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
•
difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;
•
diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business;
•
difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions;
•
difficulties in complying with regulations applicable to any acquired business, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business;
•
timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements;
•
an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;
•
undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, damaged assets liabilities, or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition;
•
negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition;
•
disruptions among employees related to any acquisition which may erode employee morale;
•
loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees;
•
an inability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we may anticipate when selecting acquisition candidates;
•
recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;
•
incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and
•
becoming subject to litigation.
Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders’ ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility. If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders. In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations.
If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results.
At December 31, 2020, we had $35.3 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results.
Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect.
The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:
•
the market price for new equipment of a like kind;
•
the age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age;
•
the supply of used equipment on the market;
•
technological advances relating to the equipment;
•
worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and
•
general economic conditions.
We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers’ sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1% of total revenues over the last five years. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in bad debt relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher bad debt expense. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
Our modular, electronics and liquid and solid containment rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modular and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers’ selling prices. Liquid and solid containment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, using quality components and repairing and maintaining the products to prevent leaks. For each of our modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected.
The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, solid and liquid waste and hazardous substances handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers’ properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances.
Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability. For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles. We also own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material. In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations.
