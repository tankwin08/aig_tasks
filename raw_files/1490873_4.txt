Equity Compensation Plan Information
On September 1, 2012, the board of directors of the Company adopted the 2012 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "2012 Plan"). Under the 2012 Plan, 25,000,000 restricted shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted from time to time under the stock option plan. The 2012 Plan is intended to assist the Company in securing and retaining key employees, directors and consultants by allowing them to participate in the Company's ownership and growth through the grant of incentive and non-qualified options. Under the 2012 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options only to key employees and employee directors, or the Company may grant non-qualified options to employees, officers, directors and consultants. Subject to the provisions of the 2012 Plan, the board of directors will determine who shall receive options, and the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased under the options.
As of January 31, 2016, the Company had granted a total of 6,500,000 options to purchase common shares under this plan. In connection with the options granted, a total of $2,665,000 has been recorded as deferred compensation and was expensed during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 and prior.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017, in accordance with the terms of the underlying option agreements, upon the termination of services to the Company by the consultant and the officer holding the granted options, all outstanding stock options expired unexercised 90 days thereafter. As at January 31, 2017 there are no options outstanding under the 2012 Employee Stock Option Plan.
On January 1, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The purpose of this Plan is to attract, retain and motivate the officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as well as provide a means of compensation for consultants, and to promote the success of the Company's business by providing them with appropriate incentives and rewards either through a proprietary interest in the long-term success of the Company or compensation based on fulfilling certain performance goals.
The Plan shall become effective and Awards may be granted on and after January 1, 2016 (the "Effective Date"). Any Awards of incentive stock options granted under the Plan are granted subject to approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the Effective Date.

The designation of an individual as a Participant in any year shall not require that the Committee designate such individual to receive an Award in any other year or to receive the same type or amount of Award in any other year.
Awards under this Plan may be granted in any one or a combination of: (a) Non-Restricted Employee Benefit Plan Stock; (b) Restricted Stock; and (c) Other Stock-Based Awards. Awards granted under this Plan shall be evidenced by Award Agreements (which need not be identical) that provide additional terms and conditions associated with such Awards, including, without limitation, restrictive covenants, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Plan and any such Award Agreement, the provisions of the Plan shall prevail unless otherwise indicated in the Award Agreement.
