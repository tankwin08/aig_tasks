Cash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company’s operations provided net cash flow of $180.5 million for 2020 as compared to $188.0 million in 2019. The 4% decrease was primarily attributable to decreased deferred income and deferred income taxes, a lower decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other balance sheet changes.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $53.0 million for 2020 as compared to $143.1 million in 2019. The $90.1 million decrease was primarily due to $81.4 million lower purchases of rental equipment of $86.3 million in 2020, compared to 2019, and $7.8 million lower cash paid for acquisition of business assets, partly offset by $1.6 million higher purchases of property, plant and equipment and $2.6 million higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $128.5 million in 2020 as compared to $44.0 million in 2019. The $84.4 million increase was primarily due to $65.5 million higher net repayment under bank lines of credit, $13.6 million higher repurchases of common stock and $4.3 million higher dividend payments.
Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company’s rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company’s rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company’s common stock.
As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years.
Funding of Rental Asset Growth
In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $13.7 million in 2020, $12.1 million in 2019 and $15.7 million in 2018, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $39.8 million, $35.5 million and $30.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 for the aggregate purchase price of $13.6 million or an average price of $48.25 per repurchased share. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan.
Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit
On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and lender, and other lenders named therein (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $670.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $12.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due March 31, 2025, the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended, the “the Prior NPA”): (i) the $40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2014 and due March 17, 2021, and (ii) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 and due November 5, 2022. In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on March 31, 2020.
On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $12.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2025, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 31, 2016.
At December 31, 2020, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $122.8 million was outstanding. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility):
•
Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1.
•
Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1.
At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants.
Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement
In March 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes due March 17, 2021, and (ii) $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes due November 5, 2022, to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply.
In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note.
On October 1, 2020, the Company entered into a rate lock agreement with Prudential Private Capital, pursuant to which, the Company agreed to a fixed interest rate of 2.57% for future issuance, if any, of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million with a 7-year maturity. If issued, the funding for such notes would occur on or before March 17, 2021 and would be subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement.
3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021
In March 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the “Series B Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity.

3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022
In November 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended.

At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million.
