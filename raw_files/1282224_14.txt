To value the contingent consideration, we used a Monte Carlo Simulation Model, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the contingent consideration. The contingent consideration was initially measured as of the date of the merger (The Door) and acquisition (Be Social) (July 5, 2018 and August 17, 2020) and is subsequently measured at each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value between balance sheet dates, being recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations.
Income Taxes
We reported an effective tax rate of (7.7)% and (25.4)% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $46,494,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and have recorded a net valuation allowance of $19,107,000 and $16,451,955 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which resulted in a decrease in this deferred tax account.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this 2020 Form 10-K.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
