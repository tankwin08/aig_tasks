In February 2016, the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases”. This new guidance eliminates the concept of off-balance sheet treatment for “operating leases” for lessees for the vast majority of lease contracts. Under ASU No. 2016-02, at inception, a lessee must classify all leases with a term of over one year as either finance or operating, with both classifications resulting in the recognition of a defined “right-of-use” asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. However, recognition in the income statement will differ depending on the lease classification, with finance leases recognizing the amortization of the right-of-use asset separate from the interest on the lease liability and operating leases recognizing a single total lease expense. ASU No. 2016-02 was in effect for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted the new guidance as of April 1, 2019.
The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients which allows entities not to reassess its previous conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs. The Company elected not to use hindsight to determine lease terms and to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component. The Company had no operating leases that were adjusted upon transition as existing leases had duration of 12 months or less at the time of transition. The Company commenced a new operating lease on premises on April 1, 2019 and recognized a right-of-use asset of $1,526,801 and a lease liability of $1,486,605 as of April 1, 2019. The adoption of the new lease standard did not materially impact the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) or the consolidated statement of cash flows. For additional disclosure and detail, see note 18 below.
(q)Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The ASU sets forth a “current expected credit loss” (CECL) model which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. As a smaller reporting company, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
3.Short-term Investments and amounts in escrow
At March 31, 2020, the Company has a $53,106 (CAD $75,000) (March 31, 2019- $38,147 (CAD $50,000) Guaranteed Investment Certificate (“GIC”) held as security against a corporate credit card. The GIC bears interest at 0.5% per annum and matured February 4, 2020.

4.Lease Receivable
On December 12, 2017, the Company completed the sale of a constructed ENVI-Marine scrubber system under an energy management lease arrangement. The Company’s lease receivable as at March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, consists of an amount due from the customer under a long-term lease arrangement.
The payments to the Company under the lease arrangement are calculated under a cost savings model. During March 2019, the Company and lessee agreed to a revised payment schedule based on a quarterly payment of $118,000 per quarter through fiscal 2022 in place of the cost saving model. The current portion presented below reflects the minimum expected payments per the lease arrangement for the next twelve months.
At the completion of the minimum required lease payments, the title of the asset transfers to the customer. No amount has been allocated to the residual value. Moreover, there are no other variable amounts involved in this lease arrangement.
5.Property and Equipment

7.Acquisition of Shanghai Engin Digital Technology Co. Ltd
On December 20, 2019, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Engin, a solar design, development and engineering company and its subsidiary. Engin’s expertise in solar technologies provides the Company another green technology to market and develop internationally alongside our manufacturing. The acquisition was concluded concurrently with two groups. The first purchase of the 75% interest was acquired for consideration of $5,864,234 (¥41,000,000) upon signing (paid), plus a further $2,145,002 (¥15,000,000) due by March 20, 2020 (not paid) and a final conditional payment of $2,860,002 (¥20,000,000) by June 30, 2020 (not paid). The remaining 25% interest was acquired for consideration of 125,000 new shares of the Company (issued after year end), plus a further conditional $286,000 (¥2,000,000) payable by June 30, 2020 (not paid). The final payments under both agreements are conditional upon the successful testing of a project, which was to be concluded by June 30, 2020. As at the date of filing, the Company is in process of getting correspondence from the two selling parties regarding the status of the project testing.
7.Acquisition of Shanghai Engin Digital Technology Co. Ltd (continued)
Total purchase consideration is estimated at $11,052,307, inclusive of the fair value of the conditional payments, which are considered probable. The 125,000 shares in the Company have been estimated to have a fair value of $368,750 or $2.95 per share. This share price is determined on the basis of the closing market price of the Company’s common shares at the date of acquisition.
The results of operations of the acquired business and the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements with effect from the date of the acquisition. The purchase consideration has been applied to cash of $2,063,358, other net working capital of Engin of $1,024,461, property and equipment of $911,330, and intangible assets of $3,897,747. The residual value of consideration after applying it to the carrying values of assets and liabilities acquired and fair value adjustments, resulted in a goodwill valuation of $3,524,161. The goodwill paid as part of the acquisition is expected to be tax deductible. The measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.
Revenue and net income of Engin since the acquisition date included in the consolidated income statement was $450,418 and $92,883, respectively.
The following unaudited supplemental pro-forma data presents consolidated information as if the acquisition had been completed on April 1, 2018. The pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of the Company with the stand-alone results of Engin:
8.Sales, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
The Company has analyzed its sales contracts under ASC 606 and has identified performance conditions that are not directly correlated with contractual payment terms with customer. As a result of the timing differences between customer payments and satisfaction of performance conditions, contractual assets and contractual liabilities have been recognized.
Contracts are unique to customers’ requirements. However, the Company’s performance obligations can generally be identified as:
●Specified service works
●Certified design and engineering works
●Acceptance of delivered equipment to customers
●Acceptance of commissioned equipment
8.Sales, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities (continued)
For the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company’s recognized sales revenues in proportion to performance obligations as noted below:

9.Convertible Debenture and Derivative Liability
On November 10, 2015, the Company entered into a $110,000 convertible debenture with a non-related party, in exchange for $100,000, net of $10,000 for legal fees which was deferred and amortized over the term of the debenture. Under the terms of the debenture, the amount is unsecured, bears guaranteed interest at 10% and default interest at 20% per annum and was due on November 10, 2016. The note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company equal to the lower of: (a) $0.40 or (b) 60% of the lowest trading price of the Company’s common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the date of conversion.
9.Convertible Debenture and Derivative Liability (continued)
The Company analyzed the conversion option under ASC 815, and determined that the conversion feature should be classified as a liability and recorded at fair value due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the conversion option. In 2017, the Company issued 470,000 shares of common stock for the conversion of $80,000 of this debenture. As at March 31, 2020, the carrying value of the debenture was $30,000 (2019- $30,000) and interest expense on the debenture for the year was recorded as $6,000 (2019- $6,000).
The fair value of the derivative liability was calculated using a binomial option pricing model. The fair value of the derivative liability is revalued on each balance sheet date with corresponding gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability of $257,102 (2019- loss of $356,081). As at March 31, 2020, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $174,484 (2019- $431,586).
The following inputs and assumptions were used to calculate the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible debenture outstanding as at March 31, 2020, assuming no expected dividends:
A summary of the activity of the derivative liabilities is shown below:

Product warranty is recorded at the time of sale and will be revised based on new information as system performance data becomes available. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company used 2% to calculate warranty provision (2019- 5%) based on management’s best estimate.
In addition, the Company incurred warranty and related costs of $794,114 during the year ended March 31, 2019 that were a reduction to the lease receivable.
