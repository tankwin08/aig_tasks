Impairment and exit charges in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.5 million, compared to $3.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. These charges in both years primarily related to plant closings undertaken for purposes of achieving operating efficiencies.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $79.9 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 15.9%, from $95.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by both the impact of lower LIBOR of $12.3 million and the impact of lower average outstanding debt balance of $4.0 million as we continued voluntarily prepaying our term loan, partially offset by $6.3 million impact of higher interest rate on the $500 million senior secured notes that were issued in July 2020. In addition, $5.4 million of the change was related to the decrease of mark-to-market loss on the interest rate swaps year over year.
Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $12.3 million, compared to a gain of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss in 2020 was primarily driven by the write-off of the deferred debt issuance cost of $13.1 million associated with our $612.5 million term loan prepayment at par with the proceeds from the offering of our Senior Notes and cash on hand, slightly offset by a gain from our $83.5
million open-market term loan repurchases at small discounts. The gain in 2019 primarily related to our open-market purchases of term loan at discounts.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit
Income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.5 million, a change of $11.8 million from an income tax benefit of $3.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is primarily due to the improvement of our operating income in 2020 to $72.9 million, compared to an operating loss of $10.6 million in 2019. The increase in income tax expense was partially offset by an $11.8 million reversal of valuation allowance in 2020 as our operating income continues to improve.
Segment Results of Operations
(1) For purposes of evaluating segment performance, the Company's chief operating decision maker reviews earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as a basis for making the decisions to allocate resources and assess performance. Our discussion below includes the primary drivers of EBITDA. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, for segment EBITDA reconciliation to income (loss) before income taxes.
(2) During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reclassified the pressure pipe business from Water segment to Drainage segment to better align with our organizational structure. The US and Canadian Pressure Pipe businesses were formerly managed by the Water segment management team, however Forterra changed its internal management structure to include the remaining Canadian Pressure Pipe plant under the same management team that oversees the Canadian Pipe & Precast operations. As a result, historical segment data were restated to reflect the current segment compositions.

Net Sales
Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $887.4 million, a decrease of $25.6 million, or 2.8%, from $913.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily the net effect of a $91.3 million decrease due to lower shipment volumes in our pipe and precast products driven by less favorable weather in 2020 compared to 2019, temporary project delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our margin-enhancing "value before volume" commercial strategy; partially offset by a $53.7 million increase driven by
higher average selling price in our pipe and precast products. Pipe and precast products revenues accounted for more than 85% of the net sales in this segment. The remaining increase in net sales was primarily related to our structural precast business and was driven by higher shipment volumes.

In addition, $7.8 million of the change related to the increase in interest expense due to the mark-to-market on the interest rate swaps year over year. The remainder of the interest expense increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average interest rates.
Other Income, net
Other income, net of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the gain from a divestiture transaction that was completed in February 2018.
