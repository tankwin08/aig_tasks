Redemption Rights
The holders of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock did not have redemption rights; however, as noted above, the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation that was in effect prior to the IPO provides that upon a Liquidation Event such shares will be entitled to receive the applicable Liquidation Amount.
Common Stock
The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Company to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 710,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. Both classes of common stock have a par value of $0.0001 per share. Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share and Class B common stock is entitled to 20 votes per share. A share of Class B common stock is convertible into a share of Class A common stock voluntarily at any time by the holder, and will convert automatically into a share of Class A common stock upon the earlier of (a) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock at the time of such vote or consent, voting as a separate series, and (b) the 20-year anniversary of the closing of the IPO. In addition, with certain exceptions as further described in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, transfers of Class B common stock will result in the conversion of such share of Class B common stock into a share of Class A common stock.
Under the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company was also authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock and 26,000,000 shares of Class H common stock. Each share of Class C common stock is entitled to no votes and will not be convertible into any other shares of the Company’s capital stock. Each share of Class H common stock is entitled to no votes and will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not the Company’s subsidiary.
The Company had shares of common stock reserved for issuance as follows (in thousands):
(1) Includes warrants issued in connection with the Second Lien Loan as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Class A Common Stock Warrants and Class B Common Stock Warrants below for further discussion.

Class B Common Stock Warrants
In connection with the closing of the Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock financing in 2015, the Company issued warrants exercisable for up to 429,672 shares of Class B common stock. The amount exercisable was based on specific financial milestones achieved during 2018 and 2019. Due to the nature of the terms of the warrants, the warrants qualified as a liability-classified derivative. The warrants were valued as of the issuance date using a Monte Carlo simulation model with varying assumptions including booking projections and probability of achievement. The warrants were marked to market at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in sales and

marketing expense, given that the warrants are dependent on selling related activities. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, the changes in the fair value of the warrant liability were not material. Based on the milestones achieved, as of December 31, 2019, the warrants were exercisable for 237,756 shares of Class B common stock and on December 31, 2019, the fair value of the derivative warrant liability of $14.1 million was reclassified from liability to equity as it met the requirements for permanent equity classification. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the warrants were exercised by the respective holders.
In addition, in connection with the execution of a prior loan agreement, the Company issued a warrant for 150,000 shares of Class B common stock, exercisable any time through June 2019. In June 2019, the warrant was net exercised for a total of 144,986 shares of Class B common stock.
Equity Incentive Plans
2008 Equity Incentive Plan

The 2008 Plan provided for the issuance of incentive stock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NQSOs”), restricted stock awards and RSUs.

A total of 50.0 million shares of Class B common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan and the 13.2 million shares remaining for issuance under the 2008 Plan were added to the number of shares available under the 2018 Plan. The expiration of the 2008 Plan had no impact on the terms of outstanding awards under that plan. All unvested equity canceled under the 2008 Plan were added to the 2018 Plan and made available for future issuance.
Assumed Equity Incentive Plan
In connection with the acquisition of HotelTonight, the Company assumed stock options and RSUs under HotelTonight’s equity incentive plan (the “Assumed Equity Incentive Plan”). As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, a total of 246,998 and 150,816 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, respectively, were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under this assumed plan.

In addition, as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, a total of 55,148 and 12,550 RSUs, respectively, were issued and outstanding under this assumed plan. No additional stock options or RSUs may be granted under the Assumed Equity Incentive Plan.
2020 Incentive Award Plan
In 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Incentive Award Plan (the “2020 Plan,” and together with the 2008 Plan, 2018 Plan, and the Assumed Equity Incentive Plan, the “Plans”). Under the 2020 Plan, 62,069,613 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance. The number of shares initially reserved for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2020 Plan will be increased by (i) the number of shares subject to awards outstanding under the 2008 Plan, Assumed Equity Incentive Plan, and 2018 Plan as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan that subsequently terminate, are exchanged for cash, surrendered or repurchased, or are tendered or withheld to satisfy any exercise price or tax withholding obligations and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each year beginning in 2022 and ending in 2030, equal to the lesser of (A) 5% of the shares of all series of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding year and (B) such smaller number of shares of stock as determined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that no more than 371,212,920 shares of stock may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options.

Common Shares Issued for Conversion of Convertible Note
In connection with its Luxury Retreats acquisition, the Company entered into an unsecured convertible promissory note with a stockholder of Luxury Retreats. The note converted into 1,236,788 unvested shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on May 15, 2017. The fair value of the shares issued upon conversion of the note was $64. 9 million and was recognized as compensation expense within product development expenses over the four-year vesting period. The Company recognized compensation expense, in product development within the consolidated statements of operations, of $19.6 million and $34.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Restricted Stock Units
Substantially all of the Company’s RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based and a liquidity-event performance-based requirement. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is generally satisfied over four years. The liquidity-based vesting condition was satisfied upon (i) an initial public offering or (ii) change in control of the Company as defined in the Company’s equity incentive plans. The RSUs vested on the first date upon which both the service-based and liquidity-event performance-based requirements were satisfied. If the RSUs vested, the Company would deliver one share of common stock for each vested RSU on the settlement date. The liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition was deemed satisfied upon the IPO.
Restricted Common Stock
The Company has granted restricted common stock to certain continuing employees, primarily in connection with acquisitions. Vesting of this stock is primarily dependent on a service-based vesting condition that generally becomes satisfied over a period of four years. The Company has the right to repurchase or cancel shares for which the vesting condition is not satisfied.
