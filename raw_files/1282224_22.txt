DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
The Contingent Consideration arrangement requires that the Company issue up to 307,692 shares of Common Stock and up to $2 million in cash to the Door Members on achievement of adjusted net income targets, (as set forth in the Merger Agreement), based on the operations of The Door over the four-year period beginning January 1, 2018. The fair value of the Contingent Consideration at the Door Closing Date was $1,620,000. The fair value of the Contingent Consideration was estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the Contingent Consideration reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the Contingent Consideration as of the Door Closing Date. The key assumptions in applying the Monte Carlo Simulation model are as follows: a risk-free discount rate of between 2.11% and 2.67% based on the U.S government treasury obligation with a term similar to that of the contingent consideration, a discount rate of between 20.0% and 20.5%, and an annual asset volatility estimate of 62.5%. Changes in the fair value on the Contingent Consideration are recorded at each balance sheet date with changes reflected as gains or losses on the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for further discussion on the fair value as of December 31, 2020.
Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations
The following presents the pro forma consolidated operations as if Be Social and Shore Fire had been acquired on January 1, 2019:
The pro forma amounts for 2019 have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of the acquisitions to reflect (a) the amortization that would have been charged, assuming the intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions had been recorded on January 1, 2019 and (b) to exclude $106,015 of acquisition costs that were expensed by the Company.
The pro forma amounts for 2020 have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies to the financial statements of Be Social and adjusting the results of the acquisition of Be Social to (a) reflect the amortization that would have been charged assuming the intangible assets had been recorded on January 1, 2019 and (b) exclude $93,042 of acquisition related costs that were expensed by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The impact of the acquisition of Shore Fire and Be Social on the Company’s actual results for periods following the acquisitions may differ significantly from that reflected in this unaudited pro forma information for a number of reasons. As a result, this unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s financial condition or results of operations would have been had the acquisitions been completed on January 1, 2019, as provided in this pro forma financial information. In addition, the pro forma financial information does not purport to project the future financial condition and results of operations of the combined company.
