Competition
The businesses in which we engage are highly competitive. Through 42West, The Door and Shore Fire, we compete against other public relations and marketing communications companies, as well as independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships. Through Viewpoint and Be Social, we compete against other creative branding and influencer marketing agencies, as well as in-house teams at many of our clients. Our content production business faces competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, video games and computer-related activities. We are subject to competition from other digital media and motion production companies, as well as from large, well-established companies within the entertainment industry that have significantly greater development, production, distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the acquisition of literary properties and for the services of producers, directors, actors and other artists as well as creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our business. In addition, our productions compete for audience acceptance and advertising dollars.
We believe that we compete on the basis of the following competitive strengths:
·
Market Reputations of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire- 42West, The Door and Shore Fire consistently rank among the most prestigious and powerful public relations firms in the United States (each ranking in the Top 50 Most Powerful PR Firms in the most recent ranking, as published by the New York Observer), which is a significant competitive advantage given the nature of the entertainment marketing and public relations industry, in which “perception is power;”
·
An Exceptional Management Team-our CEO, Mr. O’Dowd, has a 20-year history of producing and delivering high-quality family entertainment. In addition, 42West’s CEO, Amanda Lundberg, The Door’s CEO, Charlie Dougiello, and President, Lois O’Neill, and Shore Fire’s President Marilyn Laverty are all longtime PR practitioners, with decades of experience, and are widely regarded as being among the top communications strategists in the entertainment, hospitality and music industries, as evidenced by the market reputation of their companies; and
·
Our Ability to Offer Interrelated Services-we believe that our ability to offer influencer marketing expertise and creative branding opportunities for our 42West, The Door and Shore Fire clients, primarily through the services of Be Social and Viewpoint, will allow us to expand and grow our relationships with existing clients and also attract new ones.
·
Our Ability to Offer Services Across Multiple Verticals of Entertainment - we believe that our ability to offer relationship access and marketing reach across all of the film, television, podcast, music, celebrity chef, hospitality, gaming and e-sports industries will be attractive to marketers of consumer products who desire a broad campaign across pop culture, which will allow us to expand our client base and grow the size of our campaigns.

section_1A: ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Risks Related to our Business and Financial Condition
The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely impacted the global economy, the entertainment industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the extent of the continuing impact is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant operational volatility, uncertainty and disruption, both in the global economy, in general, and in the hospitality and entertainment industries, in particular. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted, including:
·
the duration and scope of the outbreak;
·
governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the outbreak, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, work-at-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders and shut-downs;
·
the effectiveness and timing of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, or any perceived limitations of or setbacks in these efforts;
·
the impact of the outbreak on the financial markets and economic activity generally;
·
the effect of the outbreak on our clients and other business partners;
·
our ability to access the capital markets and sources of liquidity on reasonable terms;
·
potential goodwill or other impairment charges;
·
our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our Term Loan agreement with Bank United;
·
increased cybersecurity risks as a result of remote working conditions;
·
our ability during the outbreak to provide our services, including the health and wellbeing of our employees; and
·
the ability of our clients to pay for our services during and following the outbreak.
A continued slowdown in the economy has had, and we expect will continue to have, a negative impact on many of our clients. Some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, thereby decreasing the market and demand for some of our services. In addition, many businesses have adjusted, reduced or suspended operating activities, which has negatively impacted the markets we serve. All of the foregoing has and will continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and forward-looking expectations. The potential effects of COVID-19 could also heighten the risks disclosed in many of our other risk factors that are included below, including as a result of, but not limited to, the factors listed above.
Our loans under the Paycheck Protection Program may not be forgiven or may subject us to challenges and investigations regarding qualification for the loan.
