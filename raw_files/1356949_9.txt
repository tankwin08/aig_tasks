8.Stockholders’ Equity
On March 7, 2014, the Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to $25 million of its outstanding shares of common stock from time to time, depending on market conditions, trading activity, business conditions and other factors. Shares of stock purchased under the program are held as treasury shares and may be used to satisfy the exercise of options, issuance of restricted stock, to fund acquisitions or for other uses as authorized by the Board of Directors. In November 2016, the Board of Directors suspended purchases under the stock repurchase program. In August 2019, the plan was reactivated and during 2019, the Company purchased an aggregate of 235,500 shares for a total cost of $1.1 million. There were no purchases under the program in 2020.
Under the terms of the 2017 Stock Plan, the Company acquired 25,201 shares and 26,731 shares that were surrendered by the holders to pay withholding taxes in 2020 and 2019, respectively. (See Note 10)

No shares of preferred stock have been issued.
9.Retirement-related Benefits
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company maintains a combination profit-sharing plan and salary deferral plan for the benefit of its employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Employees who are eligible to participate in the plan can contribute a percentage of their base compensation, up to the maximum percentage allowable not to exceed the limits of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(k), 404, and 415, subject to the IRS-imposed dollar limit. Employee contributions are invested in certain equity and fixed-income securities, based on employee elections. From January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2020, the Company matched 100% of the first 1% of the employee’s contribution. The Company’s match for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.1 million and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $0.2 million for each year.
Defined Benefit Plan
The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for those current and former employees of Vertex who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Effective November 30, 2019, there are no active employees in the plan as the plan was frozen with the closure of Vertex’s Massachusetts facility. The benefit provisions to participants of the defined benefit plan were calculated based on the number of years of service and an annual negotiated plan benefit per year of service. Annual compensation (or future compensation increases) is not used in calculating the benefit or future plan contributions. It is the Company’s policy to fund amounts for pensions sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws, which currently approximate the benefit payments made each year. A total contribution of less than $0.1 million was made during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of November 30, 2019, the defined benefit plan is inactive, with no additional incremental benefits being accrued.
The current projected benefit obligation was $0.8 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation was 2.0% and 3.2% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The fair value of the assets of the defined benefit plan was $0.8 million and $1.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The plan assets are all classified as Level 1 and as such have readily observable prices and therefore a reliable fair market value.
10.Incentive Plans
The Houston Wire & Cable Company 2017 Stock Plan (the “2017 Plan”) as amended in 2019, provides for discretionary grants of stock options, stock awards, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs) to employees and directors up to a total of 2,500,000 shares. Shares issuable under the 2017 Plan may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares. If any award granted under the 2017 Plan expires, terminates or is forfeited or cancelled for any reason, the shares subject to the award will again be available for issuance. Any shares subject to an award that are delivered to the Company or withheld by the Company on behalf of a participant as payment for the award (including the exercise price of a stock option or SAR) or as payment for any withholding taxes due in connection with the award, or that are purchased by the Company with proceeds received from a stock option exercise, will not again be available for issuance. The 2017 Plan’s purpose is to attract and retain outstanding individuals as employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and to provide them with additional incentive to expand and improve the Company's profits by giving them the opportunity to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in the Company.
The 2017 Plan succeeded the Company’s 2006 Stock Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which expired on May 1, 2017. The types of equity awards previously authorized under the 2006 Plan did not significantly differ from those permitted under the 2017 Plan.
Stock Option Awards
The Company may grant options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors of the Company under the 2006 Plan and 2017 Plan at no less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. These options are granted for a term not exceeding ten years and may be forfeited in the event the employee or director terminates his or her employment or relationship with the Company. Options granted to employees generally vest over three to five years, and options granted to directors generally vest one year after the date of grant. Shares issued to satisfy the exercise of options may be newly issued shares or treasury shares. Each plan contains anti-dilutive provisions that permit an adjustment of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock represented by each option for any change in capitalization. Compensation cost for options granted is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the term of the option.
The fair value of each option awarded is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. There were no options granted in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
All granted stock options have vested, with the last grant having an expiration date of December 20, 2021. The following summarizes stock option activity and related information: Schedule of stock option activity
There was no excess tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
There were no options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. There is no intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2020 as the closing stock price at the end of 2020 creates a negative intrinsic value.
The total grant-date fair value of options vested during 2020 and 2019 was $0, as all the options vested as of December 31, 2018.
Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units and Cash Awards
As a result of the approval of the 2017 Plan by the stockholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting, all cash/liability awards granted prior to stockholder approval of the 2017 Plan were reclassified to restricted stock units (equity) effective May 8, 2018. The total liability reclassified to additional paid-in-capital was $0.4 million. This modification resulted in an increase in total fair value of $0.1 million, recognized over the terms of the grants, which range from 1 to 5 years.
On November 3, 2020, the Board of Directors granted to the Company’s newly appointed Chief Financial Officer 55,000 voting shares of restricted stock under the 2017 Plan. The shares vest in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant, as long as he is then employed by the Company. Any dividends declared will be accrued and paid if and when the related shares vest.
On June 26, 2020, the Board of Directors granted 10,000 restricted stock units to the newly named executive chairman of the board. The award vests in two equal installments on June 26, 2021 and June 26, 2022. The award entitles the executive chairman of the board to receive a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of vested restricted stock units, together with dividend equivalents from the date of grant, at such time as his service on the board terminates for any reason.
On December 3, 2019, the Board of Directors granted to the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer 78,125 voting shares of restricted stock and to the former Chief Financial Officer, 19,531 voting shares of restricted stock under the 2017 Plan. The former Chief Financial Officer’s shares were forfeited when he left the Company in July 2020. The President and Chief Executive Officer’s shares vest in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant, in each case as long he is then employed by the Company. Any dividends declared will be accrued and paid if and when the related shares vest.
