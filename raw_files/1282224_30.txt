NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approximately $46,494,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2028. Federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite life and do not expire. Additionally, the Company has approximately $26,397,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for Florida state income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2029, approximately $14,856,000 of California net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2032, and approximately $3,852,000 of New York and New York City net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Further, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. Management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and has recorded a net valuation allowance of $19,107,00 and $16,451,955 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate from continuing operations is as follows:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company does not have any material unrecognized tax benefits and accordingly has not recorded any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not believe that unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months. The Company and its subsidiaries file Federal, California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York State, and New York City income tax returns. These returns remain subject to examination by taxing authorities for all years after December 31, 2016.
