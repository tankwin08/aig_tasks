In connection with the 42West acquisition, we granted put rights to the sellers to cause us to purchase up to an aggregate of 237,419 (including the shares from the earn out consideration) of their shares of common stock received as consideration for a purchase price equal to $46.10 per share during certain specified exercise periods set forth in the put agreements up until December 2020. The sellers of 42West agreed to extend the expiration of the put rights through March 31, 2021. As of the date of this report, the sellers have exercised an aggregate of 218,440 shares of common stock pursuant to the put rights. We have also purchased 24,090 shares of common stock and may purchase up to an additional 4,050 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $46.10, from certain 42West employees with change of control provisions in their employment agreements, who received shares of our common stock at the time of the 42West acquisition and will receive additional shares in 2021 related to the earn out consideration. The sellers of The Door may also earn up to 307,692 and shares of common stock if certain financial targets are achieved over a four-year period. The seller of Be Social may earn up to the equivalent of $300,000 of our common stock using a 30-day trading trailing average upon achievement of certain financial targets through December 31, 2023. The put rights and contingent consideration are embedded derivatives within our common stock requiring certain fair value measurements at each reporting period. We record the fair value of the put right liability and the contingent consideration liability in the consolidated balance sheets and we record changes to the liability against earnings or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The put rights and contingent consideration are inherently difficult to value. We could have substantial variability in the related periodic fair value measurements, which would affect our operating results and in turn could impact our stock price.

OVERVIEW
We are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DLPN”.
On August 17, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Be Social Public Relations, LLC, a California LLC referred to as Be Social. Be Social is a Los Angeles based digital communications group representing both brands and highly-engaged digital influencers. As consideration for the acquisition of the membership interest of Be Social we agreed to pay to the seller, Ms. Alison Grant, (i) $1.5 million in cash and 69,907 shares of our common stock on August 17, 2020 and (ii) issue shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $350,000 on January 4, 2021. We may also pay up to $800,000 in earnout consideration, 62.5% which will be paid in cash and 37.5% which will be paid in shares of our common stock if certain specified financial performance targets are achieved during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Ms. Grant has entered into an employment agreement with a term through December 31, 2023.
Through our subsidiaries 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the entertainment and hospitality industries. 42West, The Door and Shore Fire are each recognized global leaders in PR services for the respective industries they serve. Viewpoint adds full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group and Be Social provides digital communication capabilities through its roster of highly engaged social media influencers. Dolphin’s legacy content production business, founded by Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill O’Dowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at family and young adult markets.
We have established an acquisition strategy based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity and marketing services and content production businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as data analytics and digital marketing, can create synergistic opportunities and bolster profits and cash flow. We have identified potential acquisition targets and are in various stages of discussion with such targets. We intend to complete at least one acquisition during 2021, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so, whether in 2021 or at all.
We operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment comprises 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and Be Social and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic marketing consulting, digital marketing capabilities, creative branding and in-house production of content for marketing. The content production segment comprises Dolphin Films and Dolphin Digital Studios and specializes in the production and distribution of digital content and feature films.
On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization categorized a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and it continues to spread throughout the United States. The outbreak of COVID-19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission, such as the imposition of social distancing and orders to work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place have adversely affected our business and demand for certain of our services. One of our subsidiaries operates in the food and hospitality sector that has been negatively impacted by the orders to either suspend or reduce operations of restaurants and hotels. Another subsidiary represents talent, such as actors, directors and producers. The revenues from these clients have been negatively impacted by the suspension or reduction of content production. Conversely, the television and streaming consumption around the globe has increased as well as the demand for consumer products. Revenues from the marketing of these shows and products has somewhat offset the decrease in revenue from the sectors discussed above. We have taken steps to align our expenses with our changes in revenue. The steps being taken across the Company include freezes on hiring, staff reductions, salary reductions and cuts in non-essential spending. We continue to believe that our strategic strengths discussed above will continue to assist us as we navigate a rapidly changing marketplace. The effects of COVID-19 pandemic continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position; however, the extent of the impact will vary depending on the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19.
Effective November 27, 2020, we amended our Amended and Restated articles of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-to-5 reverse stock split. Shares of common stock and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split in the following management discussion and analysis.
