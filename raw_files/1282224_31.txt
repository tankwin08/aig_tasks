During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company assessed its status as primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE and determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary (see Note 14 - Variable Interest Entities). As a result, the Company removed the tax assets and liabilities allocable to the VIE from its balance sheet. The net effect of the removal of these was zero, as the valuation allowance against the Max Steel deferred tax assets was removed as well with the deconsolidation.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company revised the tax rate used to calculate the state portion of deferred taxes for year ending December 31, 2019, resulting in slightly higher deferred tax assets (net of deferred tax liabilities) and a corresponding slightly higher valuation allowance for year ending December 31, 2019. There was no effect on income tax expense or benefit, or on the effective tax rate of 25.4%.
Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. The deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which will either be deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.

The Company may be subject to legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management and based upon the advice of its outside counsels, the liability, if any, from any pending litigation is not expected to have a material effect in the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company is not aware of any pending litigation as of the date of this report.
Incentive Compensation Plan
On June 29, 2017, the shareholders of the Company approved the Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The 2017 Plan was adopted as a flexible incentive compensation plan that would allow us to use different forms of compensation awards to attract new employees, executives and directors, to further the goal of retaining and motivating existing personnel and directors and to further align such individuals’ interests with those of the Company’s shareholders. Under the 2017 Plan, the total number of shares of Common Stock reserved and available for delivery under the 2017 Plan (the “Awards”), at any time during the term of the 2017 Plan, will be 200,000 shares of Common Stock. The 2017 Plan imposes individual limitations on the amount of certain Awards, in part with the intention to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Under these limitations, in any fiscal year of the Company during any part of which the 2017 Plan is in effect, no participant may be granted (i) stock options or stock appreciation rights with respect to more than 60,000 shares, or (ii) performance shares (including shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other stock based-awards that are subject to satisfaction of performance goals) that the Compensation Committee intends to be exempt from the deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code, with respect to more than 60,000 shares, in each case, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The maximum amount that may be paid out to any one participant as performance units that the Compensation Committee intends to be exempt from the deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code, with respect to any 12-month performance period is $1,000,000 (pro-rated for any performance period that is less than 12 months), and with respect to any performance period that is more than 12 months, $2,000,000. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not issue any Awards under the 2017 Plan.
