Our independent registered public accounting firm is BF Borgers CPA PC of Lakewood, Colorado. The aggregate fees billed or to be billed for the most recently completed fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of its annual consolidated financial statements and review of the financial statements included in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:
The Company's board of directors pre-approves all services provided by its independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.
The Company's board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by its independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining its independent auditors' independence.
