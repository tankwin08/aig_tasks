As a result of the Tax Act, the Company derived estimated tax benefits of $160.5 million, including a net tax benefit of $83.5 million related to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities and a net tax benefit of $77.0 million related to the reduction in the Company’s statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 applied to income before taxes. These amounts totaled $0.23 per diluted share and $0.21 per diluted share, respectively.
Uncertain income tax positions: The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, numerous local and state tax jurisdictions within the U.S., and taxes in Europe. The Company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, the total reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, was $26.5 million and $21.6 million, respectively, and was included in long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, not including interest or other potential offsetting effects, is as follows:
In May 2018, the Company settled its IRS examination for fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017. As a result of the settlement, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was decreased by $27.2 million and income tax expense of $2.7 million was recorded.
The reserve as of May 31, 2020 substantially relates to the Company’s uncertain tax positions for certain state income tax matters. The Company believes the reserve for uncertain tax positions, including interest and net of federal benefits, of $26.5 million as of May 31, 2020 adequately covers open tax years and uncertain tax positions up to and including fiscal 2020 for major taxing jurisdictions. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, the entire $26.5 million and $21.6 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and net of federal benefit, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.
The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2017. With limited exception, state income tax audits by taxing authorities are closed through fiscal 2014, primarily due to expiration of the statute of limitations.
The Company continues to follow its policy of recognizing interest and penalties accrued on tax positions as a component of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with the Company’s tax positions is immaterial to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of interest and penalties recognized for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was immaterial to the Company’s results of operations.
Note M - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)
The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
Reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) are for realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities and are reflected in interest on funds held for clients and other (expense)/income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
Note N - Short-term Financing
The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of its normal and recurring business operations.
