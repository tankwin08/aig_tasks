The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted in December 2017. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2018, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act without any material adjustments to its previous estimates.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have a deferred tax liability related to its foreign earnings because it did not have any specific plans to repatriate funds from its international subsidiaries. The Company may do so in the future if a dividend can be remitted with no material tax impact.
In December 2016, the Company decided to exit the Bangalore, India branch operations of its TRS-RenTelco electronics division. The wind down of operations in India began in 2017. As a result, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards in India that management estimated the benefit of which will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were $0.6 million. If not realized, these carry forwards will begin to expire in 2023.
For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant. The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit. In 2020, 2019 and 2018 exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of $1.9 million, $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company evaluated all of its tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits during 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2016.
Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
NOTE 8. BENEFIT PLANS
Stock Plans
The Company adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), effective June 8, 2016, under which 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, plus the number of shares that remain available for grants of awards under the Company's 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) and become available as a result of forfeiture, termination, or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan, were reserved for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The equity awards have a maximum term of 7 years at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the equity award is granted. The 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan.
The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the vesting of which may be performance-based or service-based, and other rights and benefits. Each RSU issued reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant under the 2016 Plan by two shares. There were no modifications to the 2016 Plan and no awards classified as liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the share-based compensation expense was $5.5 million, $5.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively, before provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the aforementioned share-based compensation expenses. There was no capitalized share-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Stock Options
As of December 31, 2020, a cumulative total of 9,118,500 shares subject to options have been granted with exercise prices ranging from $3.47 to $40.37. Of these, options have been exercised for the purchase of 6,378,218 shares, while options for 1,670,972 shares have been terminated, and options for 409,410 shares with exercise prices ranging from $24.60 to $40.37 remained outstanding under the stock plans. These options vest over five years and expire seven years after grant. To date, no options have been issued to any of the Company’s non-employee advisors. As of December 31, 2020, 1,548,908 shares remained available for issuance of awards under the stock plans.
A summary of the Company’s option activity and related information for the three years ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:
The intrinsic value of stock options at any point in time is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and sold under the Company’s stock option plans was $11.9 million, $9.1 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $0.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation option arrangements granted under the Company’s stock plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than one year.
The following table indicates the options outstanding and options exercisable by exercise price with the weighted-average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding and the weighted-average exercise price at December 31, 2020:
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term and the expected number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
No options were granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Restricted Stock Units
The following table summarizes the activity of the Company’s RSUs, which includes service-based and performance-based awards, for the three years ended December 31, 2020:
Performance-based RSUs issued prior to 2018 vest over five years, with 60% of the shares immediately vesting after three years when the performance criteria has been determined to have been met and 20% of the remaining shares vesting annually at the anniversary of the performance determination date, subject to continuous employment of the participant. The 2018, 2019 and 2020 performance-
based RSU grants vest after three years with 100% of the shares vesting immediately when performance criteria has been determined to have been met. There were 184,091 performance-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2020. Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s directors generally vest over twelve to fourteen months. Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s management vest over three years. There were 93,040 service-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2020. No forfeitures are currently expected. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 based on the weighted average grant date values was $3.9 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $4.6 million, $4.7 million and $2.6, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $7.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.
Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plans
The McGrath RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan (the “KSOP”) provides that each participant may annually contribute an elected percentage of his or her salary, not to exceed the statutory limit. Each employee who has at least three months of service with the Company and is 21 years or older, is eligible to participate in the KSOP. The Company, at its discretion, may make matching contributions. Contributions are expensed in the year approved by the Board of Directors. Dividends on the Company’s stock held by the KSOP are treated as ordinary dividends and, in accordance with existing tax laws, are deducted by the Company in the year paid. For the year ended December 31, 2020 dividends deducted by the Company were $0.4 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million in 2020.
At December 31, 2020, the KSOP held 240,187 shares, or 1% of the Company’s total common shares outstanding. These shares are included in basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
NOTE 9. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 for the aggregate purchase price of $13.6 million or an average price of $48.25 per repurchased share. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan.
NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases. Most of the lease agreements provide the Company with the option of renewing its lease at the end of the lease term, at the fair rental value. In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Minimum payments under these leases, exclusive of property taxes and insurance, are as follows:
