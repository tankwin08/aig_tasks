NOTE 14 - CONTRACT LIABILITIES
The Company receives advance payments from customers for public relations projects or as deposits for promotional or brand-support video projects, that it records as contract liabilities. Once the work is performed or the projects are delivered to the customer, the contract liabilities are deemed earned and recorded as revenue. Advance payments received are generally for short duration and are recognized once the performance obligation of the contract is met. The balance in contract liability as of December 31, 2019 was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had balances of $1,855,209 and $309,880, respectively, in contract liabilities.
NOTE 15 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is a special-purpose entity (“SPE”). SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.
The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Company has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Company considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities.
