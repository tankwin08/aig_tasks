As more fully described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences of $87.1 million, net of a $1.7 million valuation allowance. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of all available evidence, in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Auditing management’s assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets involved complex auditor judgment because management’s estimate is highly judgmental and based on significant assumptions that may be affected by future market or economic conditions.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets. This included controls over management’s scheduling of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and projections of future taxable income.
Among other audit procedures performed, we tested the Company’s scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary taxable differences, including evaluation of the timing of the reversal pattern. We evaluated the assumptions used by the Company to develop projections of future taxable income by jurisdiction and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in its projections. For example, we compared the projections of future taxable income with the actual results of prior periods, as well as management’s consideration of current industry and economic trends. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s projections and compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company.

1. Organization and description of the business
General
Forterra, Inc. (‘‘Forterra’’ or the ‘‘Company’’) is involved in the manufacturing, sale and distribution of building products in the United States (‘‘U.S.’’) and Eastern Canada. Forterra’s primary products are concrete drainage pipe, precast concrete structures, and water transmission pipe used in drinking and wastewater systems. These products are used in the residential, infrastructure and non-residential sectors of the construction industry.
Forterra, a Delaware corporation, was formed on June 21, 2016 to hold the business of Forterra Building Products following an internal reorganization transaction in connection with its initial public offering in 2016 ("IPO").
The business of Forterra Building Products included indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd., ("LSF9"). Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P., which is referred to along with its affiliates and associates, but excluding the Company and other companies that it owns as a result of its investment activity, as Lone Star, through its wholly-owned subsidiary LSF9, acquired the business of Forterra Building Products on March 13, 2015, (‘‘Acquisition’’). LSF9, which was formed on February 6, 2015 for the purpose of acquiring the business of Forterra Building Products had no operations prior to the date of the Acquisition.
Initial Public Offering
On October 6, 2016, Forterra filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1,000 with a par value of $0.01 per share to 190,000,000 with a par value of $0.001 per share, and, immediately after which, effected a 41,619.472 for one stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock previously approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Following the stock split there were 41,619,472 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has also authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock that may be issued at the approval of the Company's Board of Directors. No shares of preferred stock have been issued or were outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
On October 25, 2016, Forterra sold 18,420,000 shares of common stock in its IPO at a public offering price of $18.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $313.3 million in the IPO before offering costs.
Reorganization
Prior to the consummation of the IPO, LSF9 distributed its brick operations in the United States and Eastern Canada to an affiliate of Lone Star, or the Bricks Disposition, recognized as a return of capital in the statement of shareholders' equity. Following the Bricks Disposition and prior to the consummation of the IPO, the remaining building products operations of LSF9 in the United States and Eastern Canada, were transferred to Forterra, Inc. in an internal reorganization under common control transaction (the "Reorganization"). Following the Reorganization, Forterra, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Forterra US Holdings, LLC, which is indirectly wholly owned by an affiliate of Lone Star.
Refinancing
Concurrent with the completion of the IPO, Forterra entered into a new asset based revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes, (the "Revolver"), and a new $1.05 billion senior term loan facility ("Term Loan"). On May 1, 2017, the Company amended the Term Loan to increase the principal outstanding by an additional $200.0 million and to reduce the interest margin applicable to the full balance thereof. The terms of the Term Loan and Revolver are described in greater detail in Note 11, Debt and deferred financing costs.

At the Effective Time:
(1)each restricted stock unit that is solely subject to time-based vesting requirements granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such vested restricted stock unit;
(2)each restricted stock unit that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately vest and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to such vested restricted stock unit immediately prior to the Effective Time as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement;
(3)
each option to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest, to the extent not vested previously, and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the remainder, if positive, of (A) the Merger Consideration minus (B) the exercise price per share of Common Stock of such option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such vested option; and
(4)
each Company Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately vest in full and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings) equal to the Merger Consideration.
Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others: (i) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (ii) the absence of any order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, other legal restraint or prohibition or any law enacted or deemed applicable by a governmental entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger; (iii) the passing of twenty (20) days from the date on which the Company mails to the Company’s stockholders the Information Statement (as defined below) in definitive form; (iv) subject to certain qualifications, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the other party set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (v) the performance by the other party in all material respects of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.
