8. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net
The Company has goodwill which has been recorded in connection with its acquisition of businesses. The following table summarizes the changes in goodwill by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands):
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has three reporting units which have goodwill. We perform our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill & Other, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If, after assessing the totality and events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary and our goodwill is considered to be unimpaired. However, if based on our qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will proceed with performing the quantitative impairment test.
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of the qualitative assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.
For quantitative impairment test, the Company uses a combination of an income approach and a market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The income approach uses a reporting unit's estimated future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third-party buyer. The market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to the reporting unit. The calculation of business enterprise value is based on significant unobservable inputs, such as price trends, customer demand, material costs and discount rates, and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company's impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments, as discussed above. Different assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations.
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1st of each year. In 2020, the fair value for all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative test was necessary. In 2019 and 2018, we performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that the calculated fair value of the reporting units exceeded book value in all circumstances; therefore, no annual impairment charge was recorded in either of these periods.

9. Fair value measurement
The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, derivative instruments, accounts payable, long-term debt, operating and finance lease liabilities, accrued liabilities and the tax receivable agreement obligation. The carrying value of the Company's trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables, the asset-based revolver and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity or other terms related to these financial instruments. The Company may adjust the carrying amount of certain non-financial assets to fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are impaired.

Liabilities and assets classified as level 2 which are recorded at fair value are valued using observable market inputs. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates and exchange rates to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counter-party credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Company incorporates within its fair value measurements a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counter-parties, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counter-party credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Company’s own credit risk.
The estimated carrying amount and fair value of the Company’s financial instruments and liabilities for which fair value is only disclosed is as follows (in thousands):

The fair value of debt is valued using a market approach based on the indicative quoted prices for the Company's debt instruments traded in over-the-counter markets and, therefore, is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. See Note 11, Debt and deferred financing costs, for a further discussion of Company debt.
The fair value of the tax receivable agreement payable was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology using level 3 inputs as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The determination of fair value required significant judgment, including estimates of the timing and amounts of various tax attributes. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ from these estimates. See Note 16, Commitments and contingencies, for a further discussion of the Company's tax receivable agreement.
