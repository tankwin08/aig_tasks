Between April 19 and April 23, 2020, we and each of our subsidiaries, received five separate loans under the Paycheck Protection Program, referred to as the PPP Loans, which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the CARES Act, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.8 million. Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. Pursuant to Section 1106 of the CARES Act we may apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the PPP Loans. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of the loan proceeds for qualifying expenses, which include payroll costs, rent, and utility costs over the allowable measurement period following receipt of the loan proceeds. We have not yet submitted our application for forgiveness.
The SBA continues to develop and issue new and updated guidance regarding the PPP Loans application process, including guidance regarding required borrower certifications and requirements for forgiveness of loans made under the program. We continue to track the guidance as it is released and assess and re-assess various aspects of its application as necessary based on the guidance. However, given the evolving nature of the guidance and based on our projected ability to use the loan proceeds for qualifying expenses, we cannot give any assurance that the anticipated PPP Loans will be forgiven in whole or in part.
Our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions.
We are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets. Following the severe downturn in most markets following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy continues to be challenging. Economic downturns or uncertainty about the strength of the global economy in generally, or economic conditions in certain regions or market sectors, and caution on the part of marketers, can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. In addition, market conditions can be and have been adversely affected by natural and human disruptions, such as natural disasters, public health crises, severe weather events, military conflict or civil unrest. Our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. In the past, including in connection with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. This pattern may recur in the future. Furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. If our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client spending, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations.
Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements included with this report are presented under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, such as incurring substantial recurring net losses and losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.6 million, of which $0.7 million is a guaranty for certain leases and a working capital deficit of $3.0 million. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional capital to fund our operating expenses through loans and additional sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital. If we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not have enough financial resources to support our business and operations and, as a result, may not be able to continue as a going concern and could be forced to liquidate. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainties. Please also see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have a history of net losses and may continue to incur net losses.
We have a history of net losses and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, our net loss was $1,939,192 and $2,327,900. Our accumulated deficit was $97,972,041 and $97,158,766 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our ability to generate net profit in the future will depend on our ability to realize the financial benefits from the operations of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint, Be Social and to successfully produce and commercialize multiple web series or films, as no single project is likely to generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate net profit at some point, we will not be able to meet our debt service or working capital requirements. As a result, we may need to (i) issue additional equity, which could substantially dilute the value of your share holdings, (ii) sell a portion or all of our assets, including any project rights which might have otherwise generated revenue, or (iii) cease operations.
We currently have substantial indebtedness which may adversely affect our cash flow and business operations and may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.
We currently have a substantial amount of debt. We do not currently have sufficient assets to repay such debt in full when due, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations if we are unable to repay, extend or refinance such indebtedness. The table below sets forth our total principal amount of debt and stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Approximately $1.5 million of our total debt as of December 31, 2020 represented the fair value of the put options in connection with the 42West acquisition, which may or may not be exercised by the sellers. Approximately $3.1 million represents PPP Loans received that we expect will be partially or fully forgiven. Approximately $3.0 million of our debt is related to convertible notes payable, $1.3 million to non-convertible notes payable and $0.9 million is a line of credit with Bank United.
Our indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:
·
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future productions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;
·
we may have to pay higher interest rates upon obtaining future financing, thereby reducing our cash flows; and
·
we may need a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities.
Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance and our ability to obtain additional financing, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the profitability of our content production and entertainment publicity and marketing businesses and other factors contained in these Risk Factors, some of which are beyond our control.
If we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying digital or film productions, delaying or abandoning potential acquisitions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.
Our stock price has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.
