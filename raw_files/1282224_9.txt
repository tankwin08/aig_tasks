Direct costs decreased by approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Direct costs for Viewpoint are primarily costs attributable to the production costs of each of their projects. The decrease in direct costs is primarily related to a decrease in Viewpoint’s revenue due to COVID-19, as well as reduced direct client costs at 42West and The Door from a slowdown in business from COVID-19.
Direct costs attributable to the content production segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $0.05 million, mainly attributable to the impairment of script costs. Direct costs related to the content production segment were approximately $0.8 million for 2019. During 2019, direct costs for the content production segment consisted primarily of impairment of capitalized production for Max Steel as a result of the agreement to direct all future domestic film revenues up to $0.9 million to the print and advertising loan’s creditor, in settlement of said loan. We evaluate capitalized production costs to determine if the fair value of the capitalized production costs is below the carrying value. Based on management’s estimate of ultimate revenues for Max Steel, the capitalized production costs in the amount of $0.6 million were determined to be above fair value and were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to a full year of selling, general and administrative expenses for Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and four months of selling, general and administrative expenses for Be Social acquired in August 2020.
Depreciation and amortization had an immaterial increase of $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is directly related to the amortization of intangible assets of Shore Fire acquired in December 2019 and Be Social acquired in August 2020.
Legal and professional fees decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in audit fees and certain legal fees.
Payroll expenses decreased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In response to the business slowdown due to COVID-19, the certain staff salaries were reduced during a portion of the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of Shore Fire and Be Social payroll expense.
Other Income and Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million primarily related to the Max Steel VIE. On February 20, 2020, the lender of the production service agreement confirmed that the Max Steel VIE did not owe them any debt. We reassessed our status as the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE and concluded that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the Max Steel VIE. As a result, we deconsolidated the Max Steel VIE and recorded a loss on deconsolidation of approximately $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 14-(Variable Interest Entities) to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on our analysis of primary beneficiary status.
As previously discussed, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we agreed to exchange up to $0.9 million of future domestic revenues of Max Steel for the extinguishment of the prints and advertising loan and recorded $0.7 million of a gain on the extinguishment of that debt.
Acquisition costs consisted primarily of legal, consulting and auditing costs related to our acquisitions. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were related to the acquisition of Be Social in August 2020. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of costs associated with our acquisition of Shore Fire in December 2019.
The fair value of put rights related to the 42West acquisition were recorded on our balance sheet on the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the put rights is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the puts was $1.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of The Door and Be Social were recorded on our balance sheet on July 5, 2018 and August 17, 2020, respectively. The fair value of the related contingent consideration is measured at every balance sheet date and any changes recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss of $0.06 million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a gain of approximately $0.2 million and was related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration for The Door.
We elected the fair value option for certain convertible notes issued in 2020. The embedded conversion feature of the 2019 Lincoln Park Note meets the criteria for a derivative. The fair value of these notes and embedded conversion feature are remeasured at every balance sheet date and any changes are recorded on our consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature increased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and compared to a decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes and the embedded conversion feature of $0.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. None of the decrease in the value of the convertible notes was attributable to instrument specific credit risk and as such all of the gain in the change in fair value was recorded within net income.
Warrants issued with each of the 2019 and 2020 Lincoln Park convertible notes payable and Series “I” warrant were each initially measured at fair value at the time of issuance and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date, with changes in estimated fair value of each respective warrant liability recognized as other income or expense. The fair value of these warrants increased by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest expense and debt amortization decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to convertible promissory notes that were converted into shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion on these notes payable.
Income Tax Benefit
We had an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a benefit of $0.4 million for year ended December 31, 2019. The primary component of the income tax benefit in both years is due to a release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax liabilities of the companies acquired.
As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $46.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2028. Federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite life and do not expire. Additionally, we have approximately $26.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards for Florida state income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2029, approximately $14.9 million of California net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2032, and approximately $3.9 million, approximately $4.3 million of New York state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038, approximately $3.9 million of New York city net operating loss carryforwards that being to expire in 2038, approximately $0.6 million of Illinois net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2031, and approximately $1.3 million of Massachusetts net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2038. A portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.
In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized and we have accordingly recorded a net valuation allowance of $19.1 million and $16.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net Loss
Net loss was approximately $(1.9) million or $(0.35) per share based on 5,619,969 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(0.58) per share based on 6,382,937 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net loss was approximately $(2.3) million or $(0.70) per share based on 3,304,585 weighted average shares outstanding and approximately $(1.20) per share based on 4,285,101 weighted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to the factors discussed above.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
Year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.5 million. Our net loss of approximately $1.9 million contained non-cash items such as gain on extinguishment of debt and changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $1.3 million resulting in $0.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $1.0 million, primarily from the increase of accounts receivable for projects completed by The Door and Viewpoint at year end. Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $2.9 million. Our net loss of approximately $2.3 million contained non-cash items such as changes in the fair value of liabilities in the aggregate net amount of approximately $0.3 million resulting in $2.6 million of cash flows used in operations. This was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $0.3 million.
Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.4 million primarily related to (i) a payment of deferred cash consideration for the Shore Fire acquisition in the amount of $0.3 million, (ii) a payment of approximately $1.0 million, net of cash acquired for the Be Social acquisition and $0.08 for fixed assets purchased. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately $0.9 million and were primarily related to approximately $0.8 million for the purchase of Shore Fire, net of cash acquired and approximately $0.1 million for the purchase of fixed assets.
