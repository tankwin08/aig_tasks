Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or “GAAP”. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Additionally, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. However, we have made appropriate accounting estimates on certain accounting matters, which include the allowance for doubtful accounts, carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets, based on the facts and circumstances available to us as of the reporting date. Our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to our financial statements in future reporting periods.
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill
As of December 31, 2020, in connection with its acquisitions of 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire and Be Social, we have a balance of $19,627,856 of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet which management has assigned to the entertainment publicity and marketing segment. This amount includes a provisional goodwill balance of $1,555,030 related to the Be Social acquisition and a working capital adjustment in the amount of $124,836 pursuant to the Shore Fire purchase agreement that were each made during the year ended December 31, 2020. We account for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC No. 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires goodwill to be reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. We evaluate goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.
We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its’ carrying amount, including goodwill. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its’ carrying amount, we conduct a quantitative goodwill impairment test. This impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its’ carrying value (including goodwill). We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its’ carrying value, a goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and an impairment loss is recorded.
We determined that the adverse effects of COVID-19 on certain of the industries in which we operate could be an indicator of a possible impairment of goodwill. As such, we updated our estimates and assumptions, with the information available as of the date of the assessment, performed an impairment test on the carrying value of our goodwill and determined that an impairment adjustment was not necessary. As previously discussed, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. Our future assessment of the magnitude of the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business could result in impairment of goodwill in future reporting periods.
