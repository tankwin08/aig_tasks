5)Provide that if the $10.0 million cash payment is made timely, no interest will accrue or be due under the outstanding debentures for the periods subsequent to August 31, 2020, however, interest will again accrue on these outstanding debentures at a rate of 18% per annum subsequent to August 31, 2020 if the $10.0 million cash payment is not made timely;
6)Provide that during the 90-day redemption period (or until the occurrence of certain specified events, if earlier), the investors will forbear from exercising any remedies against the Company or Mr. Diamantis as a result of any existing defaults under the outstanding securities; and
7)Provide that the embedded conversion options of the outstanding debentures noted in Number 3 above have been suspended as of August 31, 2020 and that the conversion terms will only be reinstated to their original terms after November 29, 2020 if the $10.0 million cash payment is not made.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, the Company recorded (i) a $2.0 million gain on the extinguishment of debt, a $0.3 million fair value adjustment to the debenture principal, partially offset by the reduction in interest expense of $2.3 million; and (ii) deemed dividends of $3.7 million as a result of the exchange of the debentures and Series I-1 and I-2 Preferred Stock into shares of the Series N Preferred Stock. The redemption right was not exercised and all such additional amounts have become due and payable.
The debentures issued during the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued at a discount of $0.1 million and accordingly, the Company realized a total of $3.8 million in proceeds from the issuances of debentures during 2019. The debentures issued in 2017 and 2018 were also issued with discounts. These discounts represented original issue discounts, the relative fair value of the warrants issued with the debentures, the value of the modifications of certain of these warrants, and the relative fair value of the beneficial conversion features of the debentures. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $16.2 million of such amortization of debt discount expense in connection with the debentures and warrants. These amounts included debt discount amortization that resulted from the modification of warrants as more fully discussed in Notes 12 and 14. All of the discounts associated with the debentures were fully amortized as of December 31, 2019. In addition to the amortization of discounts, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred interest expense on debentures of $6.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
The March 2017 Debentures and the September 2017 Debentures were issued with warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. Outstanding warrants are more fully discussed in Note 14.
See Notes 3, 14 and 20 for a discussion of the dilutive effect of the outstanding convertible debentures, warrants and convertible preferred stock as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $256.4 million and $123.9 million of deemed dividends as a result of the down round provision of debentures and warrants. See Notes 2 and 12.
Note 10 - Related Party Transactions
In addition to the transactions discussed in Notes 6 and 8, the Company had the following related party activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Alcimede billed $0.5 million and $0.4 million for services for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, pursuant to a consulting agreement originally entered into in 2012. It is subject to annual renewals. Seamus Lagan, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole manager of Alcimede (see Note 14).
The Company’s staff accountant, Ms. Kristi Dymond, received approximately $82,500 as a loan after she purchased certain land and buildings at auction in Jellico, Tennessee, that were attached to or related to the Company’s business there. The Company had no part in Ms. Dymond’s decision to acquire the property but decided that it would provide her a loan in support of her intentions to assist the Company. The loan is secured by the property and as long as the loan remains outstanding the Company is permitted the use of the assets and the assets remain security for the loan.
The terms of the foregoing activity, including those discussed in Notes 6 and 8 are not necessarily indicative of those that would have been agreed to with unrelated parties for similar transactions.
Note 11 - Finance and Operating Lease Obligations
We adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires leases with durations greater than 12 months to be recognized on the balance sheet, effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. We elected the package of transition provisions available, which allowed us to carryforward our historical assessments of (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. We lease property and equipment under finance and operating leases. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record the related right-of-use assets and right-of-use obligations at the present value of lease payments over the term. We do not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts.
Generally, we use our most recent agreed upon borrowing interest rate at lease commencement as our interest rate, as most of our operating leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate.
The following table presents our lease-related assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
The following table presents certain information related to lease expense for finance and operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1) Adjusts depreciation recorded in the prior year.
(2) Expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Other Information
The following table presents supplemental cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Aggregate future minimum lease payments under right-of-use operating and finance leases are as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in default under its finance lease obligations, therefore, the aggregate future minimum lease payments and accrued interest under this finance lease in the amount of $0.2 million are deemed to be immediately due. In July 2020, the Company entered into a settlement with the holder of one of the finance leases and paid $0.1 million as full and final settlement of the obligation as more fully discussed in Note 16.
Note 12 - Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value
In accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” the Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
● Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.
● Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets).
● Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including our own assumptions.
The estimated fair value of financial instruments is determined by the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies considered to be appropriate. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The following table sets forth the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The following table reconciles the changes in the liability categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020:
The Company utilized the following methods to value its derivative liability as of December 31, 2019 for the embedded conversion option valued at $455,336. The Company determined the fair value by comparing the discounted conversion price per share multiplied by the number of shares issuable at the balance sheet date to the actual price per share of the Company’s common stock multiplied by the number of shares issuable at that date with the difference in value recorded as a liability.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company extended the exercise period of the outstanding Series B Warrants (Series B Warrants are more fully discussed in Notes 12 and 14) twice, once to September 2019 and the second time to March 31, 2022 and recorded interest expense of $9.5 million, which represented the aggregate fair value of the modifications. The Company used the Black Scholes model to calculate the fair value of the warrants as of the modification dates. Using the pre-modification terms and related assumptions of risk free rates ranging from 2.44% to 2.46%, volatility ranging from 182.9% to 204.4% and weighted average remaining lives of .24 years to .36 years, and the post-modification terms and related assumptions of risk free rates ranging from 2.23% to 2.49%, volatility ranging from 198.3% to 259.4% and weighted average remaining lives of .48 years to 2.89 years, the changes in the fair value of the warrant instruments as a result of the modifications were estimated to be $9.5 million.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the conversions of preferred stock triggered a further reduction in the conversion/ exercise prices of any debentures and warrants containing ratchet features that had not already ratcheted down to their floor. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the incremental fair value of the debentures and warrants as a result of the decreases in the conversion/exercise prices was measured using Black Scholes. The following assumptions were utilized in the Black Scholes valuation models in the year ended December 31, 2020: risk free rates ranging from 0.09% to 0.13%, volatility ranging from 170.3% to 295.2% and lives ranging from 0.10 to 1.65 years. The following assumptions were utilized in the Black Scholes valuation models in the year ended December 31, 2019: risk free rates ranging from 2.4% to 2.6%, volatility ranging from 189.5% to 273.1% and lives ranging from 0.3 to 3.2 years. The incremental value of the debentures and warrants as a result of the down round provisions of $256.4 million and $123.9 million were recorded as deemed dividends for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Deemed dividends are also discussed in Notes 2 and 3.
