Each party’s obligation to consummate the merger is also subject to the absence of any order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, other legal restraint or prohibition or any law enacted or deemed applicable by a governmental entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger; subject to certain qualifications, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the other party set forth in the merger agreement; and the performance by the other party in all material respects of its obligations under the merger agreement. Parent’s obligation to consummate the merger is also conditioned on, among other things, the absence of any material adverse effect, as defined in the merger agreement. In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including if the merger has not been consummated on or before November 19, 2021, which date will be automatically extended for up to two additional 60-day periods under the circumstances specified in the merger agreement. As a result, we cannot assure you that the merger will be completed, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the merger agreement or within the expected time frame.
If the merger is not completed within the expected time frame or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. We could be required to reimburse certain expenses of Parent or pay Parent a termination fee of $50.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated under specific circumstances described in the merger agreement. The failure to complete the merger may result in negative publicity and could negatively affect our relationship with our stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers and strategic partners. We may also be required to devote significant time and resources to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement.
The merger agreement provides us with limited remedies in the event of a breach by Parent that results in termination of the merger agreement, including the right to a reverse termination fee payable under certain specified circumstances, as described in the merger agreement. We cannot assure you that a remedy will be available to us in the event of such a breach or that the damages we incur in connection with such breach will not exceed the amount of the reverse termination fee.
Our business is subject to restrictions while the merger is pending.
The merger agreement restricts the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent Parent’s prior written consent. The restrictions on our business activities include, among other things, restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses and assets, dispose of our assets, make investments, enter into certain contracts, repurchase or issue securities, pay dividends, make capital expenditures above specified levels, amend our organizational documents and incur indebtedness above specified levels. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding in a timely and effective manner to competitive pressures and industry developments, any of which could adversely affect our business, and financial condition and results of operations.
The announcement and pendency of the merger may disrupt business relationships, lead to employee departures, or otherwise adversely affect our business.
The announcement and pendency of the merger and our efforts to complete the merger could create uncertainty surrounding and significantly disrupt our business. Uncertainty regarding our future could adversely affect our relationship with existing and potential customers, suppliers, vendors, strategic partners or others that deal with us. For example, clients and other counterparties may delay or defer decisions concerning entering into contracts or otherwise working with us, seek to change our existing business relationships or consider doing business with other companies rather than us. Competitors may also target our customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and other risks related to the merger. The pendency of the merger may also divert management’s attention and resources towards completing the merger and preparing for integration actives and away from ongoing business and operations. Uncertainty as to whether the merger will be completed may also
affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the merger is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the merger. These risks and the resulting adverse effects on business, financial condition and results of operations could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.
We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs as a result of the merger.
We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant direct and indirect costs and expenses in connection with the merger. These costs and expenses include fees for financial, legal and accounting advisors, facilities and systems costs in anticipation of consolidation, severance other potential employment-related costs and other transaction costs. We must pay substantially all of these amounts regardless of whether the merger is completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses, including the length of time required to obtain the required regulatory approvals and satisfy the other conditions to closing the merger. If the merger is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs for which we will have received little or no benefit, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Merger-related legal proceedings could delay or prevent the completion of the merger or otherwise adversely affect us.
Litigation by purported stockholder plaintiffs and others is common in connection with public company acquisitions, regardless of the merits of these claims. The lawsuits often allege, among other things, materially misleading disclosures or omissions in public filings and breaches of fiduciary duties. Any legal proceedings filed in connection with the merger could delay or prevent the merger from becoming effective. For example, the conditions to closing the merger include the absence of any order, injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, other legal restraint or prohibition or any law enacted or deemed applicable by a governmental entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger and, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any merger-related lawsuit in which a claimant secures injunctive or other relief having the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting completion of the merger, then the merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. Moreover, any litigation could be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s attention away from our regular business, any of which could adversely affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The merger agreement prohibits us from affirmatively seeking other acquisition proposals that may be superior to the merger.
The merger agreement prohibits us from engaging in any further discussions or solicitations regarding an alternative potential acquisition of the Company. This provision prevents us from affirmatively seeking offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior to the pending merger. Further, under the terms of the merger agreement, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $50.0 million under specified conditions, including in the event Parent terminates the merger agreement for specified reasons and, within 12 months thereafter, we have consummated an acquisition proposal, as defined in the merger agreement, or entered into a definitive agreement regarding an acquisition proposal that is ultimately consummated. If the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where the termination fee is potentially payable by the Company, this payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us, and could discourage a third party from making a competing acquisition proposal following the termination of the merger agreement.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
The trading price of our common stock has been and may in the future be volatile and could decline substantially.
The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in significant fluctuations in price, regardless of our actual operating performance, include:
•actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;
•changes in market valuations of similar companies;
•changes in the markets in which we operate;
•additions or departures of key personnel;
•actions by stockholders, including the sale by Lone Star of any of its shares of our common stock;
•speculation in the press or investment community;
•general market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown;
•uncertainty regarding economic events, including in Europe in connection with the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union;
•changes in interest rates;
•our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;
•our ability to accurately project future results and our ability to achieve those and other industry and analyst forecasts; and
•new legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us, our markets or our industry.
Furthermore, at times, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry, and often occurs without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Therefore, factors that have little or nothing to do with us could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, and these fluctuations or any fluctuations related to our company could cause the market price of our common stock to decline materially.
The coverage of our business or our common stock by securities or industry analysts or the absence thereof could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume.
The trading market for our common stock is influenced in part by the research and other reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us or our business. We currently have, but may not be able to continue, research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If analysts do not continue coverage of us, the trading price and volume of our stock would likely be negatively impacted. Even if analyst coverage continues, if we fail to meet analyst expectations or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or inaccurate research, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
Lone Star may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders and may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.
Lone Star beneficially owns approximately 52.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this concentration of stock ownership, Lone Star acting on its own has sufficient voting power to effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including director elections and proposed amendments to our bylaws or certificate of incorporation. Five of the nine members of our board of directors are employees or affiliates of Lone Star.
