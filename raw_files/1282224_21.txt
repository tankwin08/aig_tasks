In its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, included in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020, the Company incorrectly reported certain revenue and direct costs. The errors involved reporting revenues and direct costs that should have been reported as pass-through expenses.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded revenues for certain Statements of Work (“SOWs”) issued under one of the Company’s existing Master Service Agreements (the “Impacted SOW’s”) as a principal. Subsequently, the Company determined that under the Impacted SOW’s they were acting as agent and that the out-of-pocket expenses were pass through expenses and should not have been recorded as revenue or direct costs in its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Specifically, due to these errors, revenue and direct costs for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020 were each overstated by $862,710. The error did not affect loss from operations, net loss, loss per share, the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows or the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity.
