The Company determined that the adverse effects of COVID-19 on certain of the industries in which it operates was an indicator of a possible impairment of goodwill. As such, during the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated its estimates and assumptions, with the information available at the time of the assessment, performed an impairment test on the carrying value of its goodwill and determined that an impairment adjustment was not necessary. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, management performed a qualitative analysis and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was not less than its carrying amount. As previously discussed, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company’s future assessment of the magnitude of the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its business could result in impairment of goodwill in future reporting periods.
Warrants
When the Company issues warrants, it evaluates the proper balance sheet classification of the warrant to determine whether the warrant should be classified as equity or as a derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in the Entity’s Own Equity (ASC 815-40), the Company classifies a warrant as equity so long as it is “indexed to the Company’s equity” and several specific conditions for equity classification are met. A warrant is not considered indexed to the Company’s equity, in general, when it contains certain types of exercise contingencies or adjustments to exercise price. If a warrant is not indexed to the Company’s equity or it has net cash settlement that results in the warrants to be accounted for under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, or ASC 815-40, it is classified as a derivative liability which is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with any changes in its fair value recognized currently in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had warrants that were classified as equity and warrants that were classified as liabilities.

Convertible Debt and Convertible Preferred Stock
When the Company issues convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, it evaluates the balance sheet classification to determine whether the instrument should be classified either as debt or equity, and whether the conversion feature should be accounted for separately from the host instrument. A conversion feature of a convertible debt instrument or certain convertible preferred stock would be separated from the convertible instrument and classified as a derivative liability if the conversion feature, were it a standalone instrument, meets the definition of an “embedded derivative” in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Generally, characteristics that require derivative treatment include, among others, when the conversion feature is not indexed to the Company’s equity, as defined in ASC 815-40, or when it must be settled either in cash or by issuing stock that is readily convertible to cash. When a conversion feature meets the definition of an embedded derivative, it would be separated from the host instrument and classified as a derivative liability carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with any changes in its fair value recognized currently in the consolidated statements of operations.
If a conversion feature does not meet the conditions to be accounted for as a derivative liability, the Company then determines whether the conversion feature is “beneficial”. A conversion feature would be considered beneficial if the conversion feature is “in the money” when the host instrument is issued or, under certain circumstances, later. If convertible debt contains a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”), the amount of proceeds allocated to the BCF reduces the balance of the convertible debt, creating a discount which is amortized over the debt’s term to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. When a convertible preferred stock contains a BCF, after allocating the proceeds to the BCF, the resulting discount is either amortized over the period beginning when the convertible preferred stock is issued up to the earliest date the conversion feature may be exercised, or if the convertible preferred stock is immediately exercisable, the discount is fully amortized at the date of issuance. The amortization is recorded similar to a dividend.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, defined as follows:
Level 1
-
Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2
-
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.
Level 3
-
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability as of the reporting date.
To account for the acquisitions of 42West, The Door, Viewpoint, Shore Fire and Be Social, the Company made a number of fair value measurements related to the different forms of consideration paid and of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In addition, the Company makes fair value measurements of its Put Rights and Contingent Consideration. See Notes 5 and 12 for further discussion and disclosures.
Leases
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires all assets and liabilities arising from leases to be recognized in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019. In July 2018, the FASB added an optional transition method which the Company elected upon adoption of the new standard. This allowed the Company to recognize and measure leases existing at January 1, 2019 without restating comparative information. In addition, the Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification.

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the lease commencement date. In addition to the Company’s lease agreements, the Company reviews all material new vendor arrangements for potential embedded lease obligations. The asset balance related to operating leases is presented within “right-of-use (ROU) asset” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The current and noncurrent balances related to operating leases are presented as “Lease liability”, in their respective classifications, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
The lease liability is recognized based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for the leases in existence on the date of adoption or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate on the date of the lease for leases entered into after January 1, 2019. The ROU asset is calculated based on the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments paid to the lessor at or before the commencement date (i.e. prepaid rent) and initial direct costs incurred by the Company and excluding any lease incentives received from the Lessor. For operating leases, the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company accounts for its lease and non-lease components as a single component, and therefore both are included in the calculation of lease liability recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes
Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effects of changes in tax laws on deferred tax balances are recognized in the period the new legislation in enacted. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, management considers estimates of future taxable income. We calculate our current and deferred tax position based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.
Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense.
Loss Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share available to the Company’s common stock shareholders equals net income or loss available to common stock shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share equals net loss available to common stock stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus any additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares had been issued. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if certain potentially dilutive instruments were exercised. The potential issuance of common stock is assumed to occur at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance of the potentially dilutive instrument, if later), under the if-converted method. Incremental shares are also included using the treasury stock method. The proceeds utilized in applying the treasury stock method consist of the amount, if any, to be paid upon exercise. These proceeds are then assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price of the Company’s common stock during the period. The incremental shares (difference between the shares assumed to be issued and the shares assumed to be purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation. Potentially dilutive instruments are not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because their inclusion is anti-dilutive.
