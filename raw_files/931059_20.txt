The fair value of the assets acquired, net of the liabilities assumed, was $0.9 million. The excess of the aggregate fair value of the net tangible assets acquired over the purchase price was $250,000 and has been treated as a gain on bargain purchase in accordance with ASC 805. The gain was due to the value of the intangible assets acquired. After evaluation, no adjustments were made to the preliminary allocation set forth below. The purchase price allocation was based, in part, on management’s knowledge of hospital operations.
The following table shows the allocation of the purchase price of Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center to the acquired identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed:
Impairment of Jellico Intangible Asset -Certificate of Need
As a result of the closure of Jellico Community Hospital on March 1, 2021, as more fully discussed in Note 20, we determined that the hospital’s intangible asset, which was a certificate of need valued at $250,000, was impaired as of December 31, 2020.
Unaudited Pro-Forma
The following presents the unaudited pro-forma combined results of operations of the Company and Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro-forma results of operations are presented for information purposes only.

Note 7 - Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:
Accrued payroll and related liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 included approximately $2.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for penalties associated with approximately $4.4 million of accrued past due payroll taxes as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we have deferred $4.4 million of HHS Provider Relief funds as more fully discussed in Note 1.

On August 31, 2020, the Company exchanged certain debentures and associated accrued interest outstanding as of that date for shares of its newly-issued Series N Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series N Preferred Stock”) and the interest accrued on certain outstanding debentures was reduced as more fully discussed in Note 9.

Note 8 - Notes Payable
The Company and its subsidiaries are party to a number of loans with unrelated parties. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, notes payable consisted of the following:
Notes Payable - Third Parties
The Company did not make the required monthly principal and interest payments due under the TCA Debenture for the period from October 2016 through March 2017. On February 2, 2017, the Company made a payment to TCA in the amount of $0.4 million, which was applied to accrued and unpaid interest and fees, including default interest, as of the date of payment. On March 21, 2017, the Company made a payment to TCA in the amount of $0.75 million, of which approximately $0.1 million was applied to accrued and unpaid interest and fees under the TCA Debenture. Also on March 21, 2017, the Company entered into a letter agreement with TCA, which (i) waived any payment defaults through March 21, 2017; (ii) provided for the $0.75 million payment discussed above; (iii) set forth a revised repayment schedule whereby the remaining principal plus interest aggregating to approximately $2.6 million was to be repaid in various monthly installments from April of 2017 through September of 2017; and (iv) provided for payment of an additional service fee in the amount of $150,000, which was due on June 27, 2017, the day after the effective date of the registration statement filed by the Company; which amount was reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2020. In addition, TCA entered into an inter-creditor agreement with the purchasers of the convertible debentures (see Note 9) which sets forth rights, preferences and priorities with respect to the security interests in the Company’s assets. On September 19, 2017, the Company entered into a new agreement with TCA, which extended the repayment schedule through December 31, 2017. The remaining debt to TCA remains outstanding and TCA has made a demand for payment. In May 2020, the SEC appointed a Receiver to close down the TCA Global Master Fund, L.P. over allegations of accounting fraud. The amount recorded by the Company as being owed to TCA was based on TCA’s application of prior payments made by the Company. The Company believes that prior payments of principal and interest may have been applied to unenforceable investment banking and other fees and charges. It is the Company’s position that the amount owed to TCA is less than the amount set forth above.
The Company did not make the second annual principal payment under the Tegal Notes that was due on July 12, 2016. On November 3, 2016, the Company received a default notice from the holders of the Tegal Notes demanding immediate repayment of the outstanding principal of $341,612 and accrued interest of $43,000. On December 7, 2016, the Company received a breach of contract complaint with a request for the entry of a default judgment (see Note 16). On April 23, 2018, the holders of the Tegal Notes received a judgment against the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has paid $44,544 of principal amount of these notes.
On September 27, 2019, the Company issued a promissory note to a lender in the principal amount of $1.9 million and received proceeds of $1.5 million, which was net of a $0.3 million original issue discount and $0.1 million in financing fees. The first principal payment of $1.0 million was due on November 8, 2019 and the remaining $0.9 million was due on December 26, 2019. These payments were not made. In February 2020, the note holder sued the Company and Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, in New York State Court for the County of New York, for approximately $2.2 million for non-payment of the promissory note. In May 2020, the Company, Mr. Diamantis, as guarantor, and the note holder entered into a Stipulation providing for a payment of a total of $2.2 million (which included accrued “penalty” interest as of that date) in installments through November 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $450,000 has been paid in cash and $1.9 million, including $0.5 million of accrued “penalty” interest, remains past due. The Stipulation is more fully discussed in Note 16.
On January 29, 2020, the Company entered into the Installment Note in the principal amount of $1.2 million. The Company used the proceeds to satisfy in full the amounts due under accounts receivable sales agreements. These sales agreements are more fully discussed in Note 4. Pursuant to the Installment Note, weekly installment payments ranging from $22,500 to $34,000 were due on or before February 5, 2020 through on or before October 21, 2020, the maturity date. The Installment Note, which was issued with an original issue discount in the amount of approximately $0.1 million, is non-interest bearing and subject to late-payment fees of 10%. The Company made payments totaling $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $0.1 million is past due, including $9,850 of late payment penalties.
As of April 20, 2020 and through May 1, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries received PPP loan proceeds in the form of promissory notes (the “PPP Notes”) in the aggregate amount of approximately $2.3 million. The PPP Notes and accrued interest are forgivable as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries. No collateral or guarantees were provided in connection with the PPP Notes. The unforgiven portion of the PPP Notes are payable over two years at an interest rate of 1.0% per annum, with a deferral of payments for the first sixteen months. Beginning sixteen months from the dates of issuance, the Company is required (if not forgiven) to make monthly payments of principal and interest to the lenders. The aggregate monthly payment of all of the PPP Notes is approximately $0.1 million. The Company intends to use the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loans, we cannot assure you that we will not take actions that could cause the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loans, in whole or in part. The Company is in the process of applying for forgiveness of the PPP Notes.

The Series M Preferred Stock is more fully discussed in Note 14.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company accrued interest of $2.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, on the loans from Mr. Diamantis.
