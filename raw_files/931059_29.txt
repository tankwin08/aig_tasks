On October 1, 2012, Medytox Solutions, Inc. (“Medytox”) entered into a consulting agreement with Alcimede LLC, which is controlled by Mr. Lagan. This agreement replaced and superseded a previous Alcimede consulting agreement. This agreement was originally for three years, and is now subject to annual renewals thereafter, unless either party gives notice of non-renewal. The agreement provided for a retainer of $20,000 per month and reimbursement to Alcimede for its out of pocket expenses. The parties agreed to cancel the options issued pursuant to the prior agreement. Under the new agreement, Alcimede was issued 4,500,000 shares of common stock of Medytox and 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of Medytox. In addition, Alcimede received options to purchase (i) 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox exercisable at $2.50 per share through December 31, 2017, (ii) 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox exercisable at $5.00 per share through December 31, 2017 and (iii) 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox exercisable at $10.00 a share through December 31, 2022. On June 29, 2015, Alcimede exercised the option to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. The parties agreed to cancel the remaining options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Medytox at an exercise price of $5.00 per share and 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share in connection with the merger of Medytox with the Company on November 2, 2015. The share amounts and exercise prices in this paragraph are on a pre-merger basis and do not reflect the reverse splits effected by the Company since the merger.
Effective September 11, 2014 and in conjunction with the appointment of Mr. Lagan as our Chief Executive Officer, such consulting agreement with Alcimede was amended to provide for a monthly retainer of $31,250, and we agreed to provide Mr. Lagan with an automobile. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Alcimede received a cash bonus of $200,000. On April 1, 2017, Alcimede agreed to a voluntary reduction in the monthly retainer to $20,833, which was increased back up to $31,250 in April 2018. In September 2020, it was agreed to pay $100,000 to renew the Alcimede consulting agreement for a three year period. It was further agreed that this consulting agreement could be assigned by to another entity and that termination of the agreement would trigger a $500,000 payment.

Item 12.
section_12: Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stock Matters.
The following table summarizes certain information regarding the beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) of our outstanding Common Stock as of March 31, 2021 by (i) each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, (ii) each of our directors, (iii) each of our executive officers, and (iv) all executive officers and directors as a group. The address of each of our executive officers and directors is c/o Rennova Health, Inc., 400 South Australian Avenue, Suite 800, West Palm Beach, Florida 33401. None of the following owns any Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. Alcimede owns all of the outstanding Series L Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series L Preferred Stock”). Mr. Diamantis owns all of the Series M Convertible Preferred Stock (Series M Preferred Stock”) and has granted to Mr. Lagan an irrevocable proxy to vote the Series M Preferred Stock.
* Less than one percent.
(1) Based on 474,730,679 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2021, and additional shares deemed to be outstanding as to a particular person, in accordance with applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with SEC rules to generally include shares of Common Stock subject to options or issuable upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of warrants, and such shares are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the person holding such options, securities or warrants, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person.
(2) Includes five shares of Common Stock and four stock options to purchase a like number of shares of Common Stock, owned of record by Mr. Lagan. Alcimede also owned 250,000 shares of Series L Preferred Stock, which were convertible into 44,483,985 shares of Common Stock on March 31, 2021. In addition, on August 13, 2020, Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Preferred Stock owned by Mr. Diamantis. As a result, as of March 31, 2021, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede owned, or had the right to vote, securities holding 55.19% of the total voting power of the Company’s voting securities. Because the conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock is determined based on the market price of the shares of Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares are convertible, and the votes to which the Series L Preferred Stock is entitled, will fluctuate.
(3) Includes Messrs. Lagan, Blum and Langley. Includes five shares of Common Stock and four stock options to purchase a like number of shares of Common Stock owned by Messrs. Lagan, Blum and Langley, as described in the above footnotes.

Alcimede, of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager, billed the Company $0.4 million and $0.4 million for consulting fees and reimbursement of expenses pursuant to a consulting agreement for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, Mr. Lagan received a payment of $100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 for renewal and amendment to the existing contract for a further three year period. On April 2, 2017, Alcimede agreed to a voluntary reduction in the monthly retainer payable by the Company from $31,250 to $20,833, which was increased back up to $31,250 on April 2018. On February 3, 2015, the Company borrowed $3.0 million from Alcimede. The note had an interest rate of 6% and was originally due on February 2, 2016. Alcimede later agreed to extend the maturity date of the loan to August 2, 2017. On June 29, 2015, Alcimede exercised options granted in October 2012 to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, and the loan outstanding was reduced in satisfaction of the aggregate exercise price of $2.5 million. In August of 2016, $0.3 million was repaid by the Company through the issuance of shares of common stock. In March of 2017, the Company and Mr. Lagan agreed that a payment made to Alcimede in the amount of $50,000 would be deducted from the outstanding balance of the note. On August 2, 2017, the Company and Alcimede agreed to further extend the maturity date of the loan to August 2, 2018. On July 20, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to authorize the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of its Series J Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series J Preferred Stock”). On July 23, 2018, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Series J Agreement”) with Alcimede. Pursuant to the Series J Agreement, the Company issued to Alcimede 250,000 shares of the Series J Preferred Stock in exchange for the cancellation of the outstanding principal and interest owed by the Company to Alcimede under the Note, dated February 5, 2015, and the cancellation of certain amounts owed by the Company to Alcimede under a consulting agreement between the parties. The total amount of consideration paid by Alcimede to the Company equaled $250,000. Each share of the Series J Preferred Stock had a stated value of $1.00 and was entitled to 8% per annum cumulative dividends at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. On September 27, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to authorize the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of its Series K Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series K Preferred Stock”). On December 29, 2019, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Series K Agreement”) with Alcimede. Pursuant to the Series K Agreement, the Company issued to Alcimede 250,000 shares of the Series K Preferred Stock in exchange for the 250,000 shares of Series J Preferred Stock. The shares of Series J Preferred Stock were cancelled and, under the Series K Agreement, Alcimede relinquished all rights to any cumulative dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series K Preferred Stock did not provide for cumulative dividends. On May 4, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to authorize the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of Series L Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series L Preferred Stock”).
