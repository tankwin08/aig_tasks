The adoption of the standard had a material impact on the Company’s financial statements, with the most significant effects related to: (i) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets for its real estate and data center operating leases; (ii) the derecognition of existing assets and liabilities for certain sale-leaseback transactions (arising from build-to-suit lease arrangements); (iii) the derecognition of existing assets and liabilities for certain assets constructed under build-to-suit lease arrangements that the Company subsequently leased; (iv) no longer reporting in the consolidated statements of operations a portion of lease expense for build-to-suit leases in interest expense, but rather, as a component of costs and expenses; and (v) providing significant new disclosures about the Company’s leasing activities.
Upon adoption, the Company recognized an operating lease ROU asset of $340.2 million and lease liabilities of $366.0 million, which included the derecognition of $62.0 million of build-to-suit assets and $84.0 million of corresponding financing obligations subsequently assessed as operating leases. The new standard also provided practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting as well as transition. The Company has elected the: (i) short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, whereby the Company will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition; (ii) practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of the Company’s leases; (iii) optional transition method that allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and will not restate prior periods, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit of $22.2 million; and (iv) transition package of three expedients, which eliminates the requirements to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, which amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities from an incurred loss methodology to an expected loss methodology. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the guidance eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and instead requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale debt securities, credit losses are recorded through an allowance for credit losses, rather than a write-down, limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. Additional disclosures about significant estimates and credit quality are also required. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU has subsequently been amended by ASUs 2018-19, 2019-04, 2019-05, 2019-10, and 2019-11. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740), which removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies U.S. GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323 and Topic 815, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides optional expedients and exceptions to contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The standard is effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022 and may be applied at the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020 or any date thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, which clarifies when an entity should assess whether a callable debt security is within the scope of accounting guidance, which impacts the amortization period for nonrefundable fees and other costs. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Upon adoption, the amendments are to be applied on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
There are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, and the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
