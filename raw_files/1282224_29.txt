NOTE 17 - LOSS PER SHARE
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted loss per share:
DOLPHIN ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing income attributable to the shareholders of Common Stock (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted earnings per share assume that any dilutive equity instruments, such as put rights, convertible notes payable and warrants were exercised and outstanding Common Stock adjusted accordingly, if their effect is dilutive.
Certain of the Company’s convertible notes payable, warrants and the Series C have clauses that entitle the holder to participate if dividends are declared to the common stockholders as if the instruments had been converted into shares of common stock. As such, the Company uses the two-class method to compute earnings per share and attribute a portion of the Company’s net income to these participating securities. These securities do not contractually participate in losses. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a net loss and as such the two-class method is not presented.
In periods when the Put Rights are assumed to have been settled at the beginning of the period in calculating the denominator for diluted loss per share, the related change in the fair value of Put Right liability recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the period, is added back or subtracted from net income during the period. The denominator for calculating diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, assumes the Put Rights had been settled at the beginning of the period, and therefore, the related income due to the decrease in the fair value of the Put Right liability during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is subtracted from net loss. The number of shares added to the denominator for the Put Rights is calculated using the reverse treasury stock method that assumes the Company issues and sells sufficient shares at the average period trading price to satisfy the Put Right contracts.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company excluded 847,191 and 842,592 common stock equivalents such as warrants and shares to be issued for convertible debt as inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
NOTE 18 - WARRANTS
A summary of warrant activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
On November 4, 2016, the Company issued warrants to T Squared to purchase up to 50,000 shares of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $70.00 per share. The warrants contain a down round provision and on October 21, 2019, as a result of the Company’s sale of Common Stock through an underwritten public offering, the exercise price of the warrants was reduced to $3.91 per share. Accordingly, the Company recorded the impact of the exercise price adjustment as deemed dividends of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The warrants were not exercised and expired on January 31, 2020.
