We maintain in-house technical sales, engineering and field service teams which provide customers technical expertise and support to assist them in finding the right product or solution for their specific need. Each of our operating segments has its own sales force. Overall, we employ more than 300 sales and related support professionals. Our sales force and customer service functions are staffed by experienced professionals who have been trained in our product lines, processes and systems, and who maintain touch points with engineers, contractors, builders, and distributors. Additionally, we have a staff of more than 130 engineers that we employ to work in concert with our sales force to help develop effective product solutions for our customers.
We sell our DIP products and our fittings and fabricated products primarily through distributors. Our drainage pipe, concrete pressure pipe, and precast concrete products are mostly sold direct to customers who are installing such products for or are the end users of such products. Drainage pipe, concrete pressure pipe, and certain precast products are sold through a bidding process in which we seek to place the most competitive bid. We undertake marketing efforts through our participation in trade shows and through our website. We outsource many of our product deliveries by using a combination of dedicated carriers and other third-party carriers.
Raw Materials and Inputs
The primary material for our drainage pipe and precast concrete products and our concrete pressure pipe is concrete, which consists of water, cement and aggregates. Another key input for our products is steel, which is used to provide reinforcement within our drainage pipe and precast concrete products. Our DIP is largely made from iron melted from recycled scrap metals. Other key materials for our DIP include foundry coke and certain additives, such as alloys.
Most of our raw materials are widely available commodities. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials. To the extent we do not produce any raw materials, when and where possible, we try to purchase raw materials from the source, and because of their low value-to-weight ratios, we generally try to source our raw materials in the vicinity of our facilities. We usually purchase the raw materials we need in the spot market, except where we anticipate a significant need of materials for a specific project. Other than certain contracts for key materials, including cement and steel, we typically do not enter into long-term supply contracts with our suppliers that require us to purchase particular quantities or to pay particular prices.
We purchase our steel from a number of different suppliers, but most suppliers are based in the United States in order to comply with “Buy America” government contract requirements placed on our customers. We endeavor to purchase these steel supplies from the entity which is as close as possible to the manufacturer.
To manufacture DIP, fabricated products and fittings, we purchase scrap metal directly from qualified scrap sources near our foundry sites in the United States and Mexico. We utilize certain categories of scrap metal, primarily shredded automobile bodies, plate & structural, and cast iron. We purchase foundry coke from two merchant coke producers in the United States, both located in Birmingham, Alabama. Major alloys and additives are procured from both domestic and foreign sources based on a semiannual bid process.
Seasonality
The construction industry, and therefore demand for our products, is typically seasonal and dependent on weather conditions, with periods of snow or heavy rain negatively affecting construction activity. For a more detailed discussion, see the sections titled Item 1A.

Risks Related to Our Industry and End Markets
Our business is based in significant part on government-funded infrastructure projects and building activities, and any reductions or re-allocation of spending or related subsidies in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our business depends heavily on government spending for infrastructure and other similar building activities. As a result, demand for many of our products is heavily influenced by U.S. and Canadian federal government fiscal policies and tax incentives and other subsidies, as well as state and municipal funding of projects. The infrastructure projects in which we participate are typically funded directly by governments and/or privately-funded but are otherwise tied to or impacted by government policies and spending measures. Government infrastructure spending and governmental policies with respect thereto depend primarily on the availability of public funds, which is influenced by many factors, including governmental budgets, public debt levels, interest rates, existing and anticipated and actual federal, state, provincial and municipal tax revenues, government leadership and the general political climate, as well as other general macroeconomic and political factors. In addition, U.S. federal government funds may only be available based on states’ willingness to provide matching funding, and state funding may not be available, particularly in light of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on state budgets. As a result, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association forecasts transportation construction activity to decline 5.5 percent in 2021. Government spending is often approved only on a short-term basis and some of the projects in which our products are used require longer-term funding commitments. If government funding is not approved or funding is lowered, whether as a result of poor economic conditions, lower than expected revenues, competing spending priorities or other factors, it could limit infrastructure projects available, increase competition for projects, result in excess inventory and decrease sales, any of which could adversely affect the profitability of our business.
