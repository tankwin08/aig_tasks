Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees.

The Company currently self-insures the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and PEO employee benefit plans. The Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of May 31, 2020.
