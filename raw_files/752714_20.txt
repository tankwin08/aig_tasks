Facility rent expense was $3.7 million in 2020, $3.9 million in 2019 and $3.5 million in 2018.
The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company.
The Company’s health plans are self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss insurance of $200,000 per claim. Beginning in 2019, the Company’s workers compensation insurance is underwritten by an insurance company with no stop-loss value and $350,000 for prior claim years. Insurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis. In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments made during a twelve month coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate. The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet paid at period end. The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates. A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulting amounts to be accrued. In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company’s loss experience develops. All of these factors have the potential for impacting the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accruals for the Company’s health and workers’ compensation high deductible plans were $2.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
NOTE 11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist of the following:
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives. Amortization expense in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.2 million, $0.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Based on the carrying values at December 31, 2020 and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization is expected to be $0.2 million in 2021 and $0.2 million in 2022 through 2026.
NOTE 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
There were no related party transactions in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, or amounts owed to related parties at such dates.
NOTE 13. SEGMENT REPORTING
FASB guidelines establish annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. In accordance with these guidelines the Company’s four reportable segments are Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex. Management focuses on several key measures to evaluate and assess each segment’s performance including rental revenue growth, gross margin, and income before provision for income taxes. Excluding interest expense, allocations of revenue and expense not directly associated with one of these segments are generally allocated to Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, based on their pro-rata share of direct revenues. Interest expense is allocated amongst Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks based on their pro-rata share of average rental equipment at cost, goodwill, intangible assets, accounts receivable, deferred income and customer security deposits. The Company does not report total assets by business segment. Summarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, for the Company’s reportable segments is shown in the following tables:
1Gross Enviroplex sales revenues were $34,014, $39,814 and $30,407 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were $1,277 and $1,361 inter-segment sales to Mobile Modular in 2020 and 2018, which have been eliminated in consolidation. There were no inter-segment sales in 2019.
2Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. The average utilization for the period is calculated using the average costs of rental equipment.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 4%, 5% and 4% of the Company’s revenues for the same periods, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the Company. Based on their evaluation the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the “reasonable assurance” level.
Management’s Assessment of Internal Control. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, is discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included on page 57.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
