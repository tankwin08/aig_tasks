Cash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $8.6 million as compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of the net of (i) $0.5 million to paydown the line of credit with Bank United; (ii) $0.3 million of principal and interest payments for the term loan with Bank United; (iii) $1.6 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iv) $0.3 million comprising the final installment of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (v) $1.9 million to repay convertible notes that matured, including $0.7 million to a related party, Leslee Dart, a member of the Board of Directors; (vi) $0.8 million consideration paid in installments as deferred cash consideration to the seller of Shore Fire; (vii) $7.6 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a registered direct offering in June of 2020 and (viii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $3.6 million. By contrast, cash flows provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $0.4 million as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of (i) $0.1 million of net repayment of debt related to Max Steel; (ii) $2.3 million used to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to Put Rights that were exercised; (iii) $0.3 million comprising the second and third installments of the consideration paid for Viewpoint; (iv) second installment of the consideration for The Door in the amount of $0.8 million; (v) final installment of the consideration paid to employees of 42West to settle change of control provisions in their employment contracts in the amount of $0.4 million; (vi) $1.9 million proceeds from the sale of common stock through a public offering in October 2019; (vii) proceeds from convertible notes payable of $2.1 million and (viii) proceeds from non-convertible note payable of $0.3 million.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash available for working capital of approximately $7.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, not including $0.7 million pledged as collateral for standby letter of credit for the New York office, and a working capital deficit of approximately $3.0 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
Our net losses, negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficit, along with an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.0 million as of December 31, 2020, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this 2020 Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. In this regard, management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through loans and additional issuances of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital. Such issuances of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially. We currently have the rights to several scripts, that we intend to produce and release subject to obtaining financing. We will potentially earn a producer and overhead fee for this production. There can be no assurances that such production will be released or fees will be realized in future periods.
Our subsidiaries operate in industries that were adversely affected by the government mandated shelter-in-place, stay-at-home and work-from-home orders as a result of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Between April 19, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we entered into five separate loan agreements and received an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 million under the Paycheck Protection Program which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Be Social, which the Company acquired on August 17, 2020, received a PPP Loan in the amount of $304,169 prior to the acquisition. The loans are unsecured and all or a portion of the loans may be forgiven upon application to the lender for certain expenditure amounts made, including payroll costs, in accordance with the requirements under the Paycheck Protection Program. There is no assurance that our obligation under these loans will be forgiven.
In addition, we have a substantial amount of debt. We do not currently have sufficient assets to repay such debt in full when due, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations if we are unable to repay, extend or refinance such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $10.9 million and our total stockholders’ equity was approximately $19.7 million. Approximately $1.5 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 represents the fair value of put options in connection with the 42West acquisition, which may or may not be exercised by the sellers. Approximately $3.1 million of the total debt as of December 31, 2020 is related to PPP Loans received that may be forgiven upon application to the lender for qualifying expenditures primarily related to payroll costs.
If we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.
Financing Arrangements
Prints and Advertising Loan
On August 12, 2016, Dolphin Max Steel Holdings LLC, or Max Steel Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dolphin Films, entered into a loan and security agreement, or the P&A Loan, providing for a $14.5 million non-revolving credit facility that matured on August 25, 2017. The loan was not guaranteed by any other Dolphin entity and the only asset held by Max Steel Holdings is the copyright for the motion picture. The loan was also secured by $1,250,000 in a deposit account and a third-party guarantee of $4,500,000, of which Dolphin agreed to backstop $620,000. The proceeds of the credit facility were used to pay a portion of the P&A expenses of the domestic distribution of our feature film, Max Steel. During 2017 the lender applied the $1,250,000 in the deposit account and the third-party guarantor paid the $4,500,000 to reduce the loan balance. Repayment of the loan was intended to be made from revenues generated by Max Steel in the United States. Max Steel did not generate sufficient funds to repay the loan prior to the maturity date. On August 23, 2019, we entered into a revenue participation agreement with the lender whereby they are entitled to the next $0.9 million of revenues from the domestic distribution of Max Steel in exchange for payment and satisfaction in full of the P&A Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million related to this revenue participation agreement.
Production Service Agreement
During 2014, the Max Steel variable interest entity (or Max Steel VIE), created in connection with the financing and production of Max Steel, entered into a loan agreement in the amount of $10.4 million to produce Max Steel. The loan was partially secured by international distribution agreements made prior to the commencement of principal photography and tax incentives. The agreement contained repayment milestones to be made during 2015, which were not met and, as such, accrued interest at a default rate of 8.5% per annum above the published base rate of HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited until the maturity date of January 31, 2016 or the release of the movie. Due to delays in the release of the film, Max Steel VIE was unable to make some of the scheduled payments and, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Max Steel VIE accrued $1.6 million of interest at the default rate. The film was released in theaters in the United States on October 14, 2016 and delivery to the international distributors began after the US release. On February 20, 2020, the Company received notification from the lender of the Production Service Agreement that the Max Steel VIE did not owe any debt to the lender. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $3.3 million during year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a balance of $0 and $3.3 million on our consolidated balance sheets related to the Production Service Agreement.
42West Line of Credit
On March 15, 2018, 42West entered into a business loan agreement with BankUnited, N.A., (the “Loan Agreement”), for a revolving line of credit agreement under a revolving note. The revolving line of credit matured on March 15, 2020 and bore interest on the outstanding balance at the bank’s prime rate plus 0.25% per annum. The maximum amount that could be drawn on the revolving line of credit was $2,300,000. Amounts outstanding under the note were secured by 42West’s current and future inventory, chattel paper, accounts, equipment and general intangibles. On March 28, 2018, we drew $1,690,000 from the line of credit facility to purchase 36,659 shares of our common stock, per the put agreements with the sellers of 42West. On February 20, 2020, in anticipation of converting the line of credit into a term loan, we partially repaid the line of credit in the amount of $500,000. On March 31, 2020 we converted the line of credit into a three-year term loan in the amount of $1,200,390. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the loan recorded on our balance sheet was $1,700,390.
Term Loan
On March 31, 2020, 42West and The Door, as co-borrowers, entered into a business loan agreement with Bank United, N.A. to convert the balance of the 42West line of credit of $1,200,390 into a three-year term loan. The term loan bears interest at a rate of 0.75% points over the Lender’s Prime Rate and matures on March 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the balance on the term loan was $900,292.
The Term Loan contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding maintenance of a maximum debt to total net worth ratio of at least 4.0:1.0 and a minimum fixed charge coverage of 1.06x based on fiscal year-end audit to be calculated as provided in the Term Loan. Further, the Term Loan contains customary negative covenants, including those that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of 42West and The Door to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans, investments or certain acquisitions, or enter into certain types of agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the bank may accelerate the maturity of the loan and declare the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In the event of 42West and The Door’s insolvency, such outstanding amounts will automatically become due and payable. 42West and The Door may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Term Loan without penalty. The bank has not yet performed its tests for compliance with debt covenants which it does on an annual basis based on the financial statements of 42West and The Door as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Based on our calculations, we believe we are out of compliance with certain debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, we have classified the entire balance of $900,292 of the Term Loan in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
