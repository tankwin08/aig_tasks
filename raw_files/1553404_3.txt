FINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.

Results of Operations
The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. Due to the significant growth in operations, sales and personnel, the comparative fiscal period shouldn’t be relied upon to provide an expectation of normal operating levels.
Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2020 was $130,138,574 versus $2,074,950 for the year ended March 31, 2019. The Company’s revenues were mainly derived from the sale of marine scrubber units and related services. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the company was in various stages of engineering, delivery, and commissioning of 107 (2019 - 1) marine scrubber units which contributed to revenue of $129,688,156 during the period (2019- $2,074,950). Engin contributed to revenue of $450,418 from providing design and engineering services for CSP contracts during the period from acquisition date of December 20, 2019 until March 31, 2020.
Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 was $51,572,419 and $139,800 respectively. Increases in the Company’s ability to deliver units, meeting customer timelines, and securing shipyards for installations has resulted in significant recognition of revenues and gross profit in the last 12 months.
The gross profit margin for the year ended March 31, 2020 was approximately 40% (2019- 7%). Management anticipates realizing margins between 20% and 40% in future periods.
Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 were $41,529,313 as compared to $17,045,691 for the year ended March 31, 2019 as the Company continued to grow its management, sales and operations teams in order to deliver on the significant order book.
Consulting fees, technical support, and commissions increased significantly to $22,905,321 from $5,426,136 for the year ended March 31, 2020 to March 31, 2019. Consulting fees, technical support, and commissions were comprised of fees paid to third parties for business development efforts, advisory services, as well as amounts paid to the directors of the Company. Consulting fees paid to third parties for business development and technical support efforts include 20% commission on ENVI-Marine scrubber unit sales to significant clients.
Office and miscellaneous, salaries and wages, and travel and accommodation expenses were recorded at $2,721,884, $6,527,743, and $3,488,165 for the year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to $268,716, $7,011,859, and $1,031,922 for the year ended March 31, 2019. The Company opened offices in various international locations, hired new employees, and incurred additional travel related costs for the year ended March 31, 2020.
