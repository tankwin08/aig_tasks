17.Segmented Information (continued)

18.Commitments
(a)The Company’s subsidiaries have entered into three long-term operating leases for office premises in London, United Kingdom, Lysaker, Norway and North Vancouver, Canada. These lease assets are categorized as right of use assets under ASU No. 2016-02.
*The Company determined the discount rate with reference to mortgages of similar tenure and terms.
Operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As the Company’s operating lease does not provide an implicit rate, the discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the remaining lease term. The operating lease asset excludes lease incentives. The operating leases do not contain an option to extend or terminate the lease term at the Company’s discretion, therefore no probable renewal has been added to the expiry date when determining lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
*Including right of use amortization and imputed interest. Lease payments include maintenance, operating expense, and tax.
18.Commitments (continued)
The Company has entered into premises lease agreements with minimum annual lease payments expected over the next five years of the lease as follows:

During the term of the agreement, the Company will provide the Supplier with a non-transferrable right and license to use the Technology to manufacture and install the product within the Asia and Russia region.
The parties will fund the venture proportionately, 50.1% by the Company and 49.9% by the Supplier, and excess operating cash flows will be distributed on a quarterly basis. Neither party have funded the joint venture to date and there has been no revenue and expense associated with it.

19.Income Taxes (continued)
At March 31, 2020, the Company is in arrears on filing a number of its statutory corporate income tax returns for certain entities, primarily, in the United States. The amounts presented above are based on estimates and what management believes are prudent filing positions, where information for fiscal years prior to 2013 has been challenging to obtain. The actual losses available could differ from these estimates upon assessment and review by taxation authorities.
We evaluate tax positions for recognition using a more-likely than-not recognition threshold, and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2020 and 2019 are primarily comprised of the following:
