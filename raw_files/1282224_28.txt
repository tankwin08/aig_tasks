NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
To assess whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivative or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Company apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE.
The Company evaluated the entities in which it did not have a majority voting interest and determined that it had (1) the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact their economic performance and (2) had the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from these entities. As such the financial statements of JB Believe, LLC are consolidated in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows presented herein for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The financial statements of Max Steel Productions LLC are consolidated in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and in consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows presented herein for the period between January 1 and February 20, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019. These entities were previously under common control and have been accounted for at historical costs for all periods presented.
The Company performs ongoing reassessments of (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain triggering events, and therefore would be subject to the VIE consolidation framework, and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company’s involvement with a VIE cause the Company’s consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Company is involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value unless the VIE is an entity which was previously under common control, which in that case is consolidated based on historical cost. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.
Max Steel VIE was initially formed for the purpose of recording the production costs of the motion picture Max Steel. Prior to the commencement of the production, the Company entered into a Production Service Agreement to finance the production of the film. The Production Service Agreement was for a total amount of $10,419,009 with the lender taking a producer fee of $892,619. Pursuant to the financing agreements, the lender acquired 100% of the membership interests of Max Steel VIE with the Company controlling the production of the motion picture and having the rights to sell the motion picture. On February 20, 2020, the lender of the Production Service Agreement confirmed that Max Steel VIE did not owe any debt under the Production Service Agreement. The Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $3,311,198. In addition, the Company assessed its status as primary beneficiary of the VIE and determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary. As such, the Company deconsolidated Max Steel VIE and recorded a loss on deconsolidation in the amount of $ $1,484,591 on its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were outstanding balances of $0 and $3,311,198, including accrued interest of $0 and $1,698,280, respectively, related to this debt which are included in the caption debt in the consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 16 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
A.
Preferred Stock
The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the power to designate the rights and preferences of the preferred stock and issue the preferred stock in one or more series.
On February 23, 2016, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to designate 1,000,000 preferred shares as Series C with a $0.001 par value which may be issued only to an “Eligible Series C Preferred Stock Holder”. On May 9, 2017, the Board approved the amendment of the Company’s articles of incorporation to reduce the designation of Series C to 50,000 shares with a $0.001 par value. The amendment was approved by the Company’s shareholders on June 29, 2017 and the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the State of Florida (‘the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation”) on July 6, 2017. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, each share of Series C will be convertible into one share of common stock, subject to adjustment for each issuance of common stock (but not upon issuance of common stock equivalents) that occurred, or occurs, from the date of issuance of the Series C (the “issue date”) until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the issue date (i) upon the conversion or exercise of any instrument issued on the issued date or thereafter issued (but not upon the conversion of the Series C), (ii) upon the exchange of debt for shares of common stock, or (iii) in a private placement, such that the total number of shares of common stock held by an “Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder” (based on the number of shares of common stock held as of the date of issuance) will be preserved at the same percentage of shares of common stock outstanding held by such Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder on such date. An Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder means any of (i) DE LLC for so long as Mr. O’Dowd continues to beneficially own at least 90% and serves on the board of directors or other governing entity, (ii) any other entity in which Mr. O’Dowd beneficially owns more than 90%, or a trust for the benefit of others, for which Mr. O’Dowd serves as trustee and (iii) Mr. O’Dowd individually. Series C will only be convertible by the Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder upon the Company satisfying one of the “optional conversion thresholds”. Specifically, a majority of the independent directors of the Board, in its sole discretion, must determine that the Company accomplished any of the following (i) EBITDA of more than $3.0 million in any calendar year, (ii) production of two feature films, (iii) production and distribution of at least three web series, (iv) theatrical distribution in the United States of one feature film, or (v) any combination thereof that is subsequently approved by a majority of the independent directors of the Board based on the strategic plan approved by the Board. At a meeting of the Board on November 12, 2020, a majority of the independent directors of the Board approved that the “optional conversion threshold” had been met. As a result, the Series C became immediately convertible and as of December 31, 2020 is convertible into 3,806,188 shares of Common Stock, subject to the restriction discussed below. Additionally, DE LLC, as the holder of the Series C is entitled to 11,418,565 votes, which are equal to approximately 63% of the voting securities of the Company.

DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
At the meeting of the Board on November 12, 2020, the Board and Mr. O’Dowd agreed to restrict the conversion of the Series C until the Board approved its conversion. Therefore, on November 16, 2020, the Company and DE, LLC entered into a Stock Restriction Agreement pursuant to which the conversion of the Series C is prohibited until such time as a majority of the independent directors of the Board approves the removal of the prohibition. The Stock Restriction Agreement also prohibits the sale or other transfer of the Series C until such transfer is approved by a majority of the independent directors of the Board. The Stock Restriction Agreement shall terminate upon a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Stock Restriction Agreement) of the Company.
The Certificate of Designation also provides for a liquidation value of $0.001 per share and dividend rights of the Series C on parity with the Company’s Common Stock.
